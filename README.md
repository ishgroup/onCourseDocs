## Building the docs

The documenation is built using gradle, so all you need to have installed on your machine is Java 11 or higher. Then run:

    ./gradlew asciidoctor

You can also build individual documentation projects with something like

    ./gradlew design:asciidoctor


## Editing

We recommend Intellij with the Asciidoc plugin installed to work on this documentation.

## Proprietary parts

The DSL documentation also has a dependency on some swagger API files which are not available under an open source license yet. We are working on making that available.
