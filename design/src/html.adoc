== Editing templates

Once you have exhausted the capabilities of styling your site purely through modifying css, you may want to customise the html which is generated by the web application.
To do this, you will edit the templates which are used to build the site. You can do this using any WebDAV editor, like https://cyberduck.io/[Cyberduck].

If you want to override the templates below, simply place your modified files into an appropriate layout.
For example to customise the body structure on the default template, create a file here:

....
/templates/default/BodyStructure.tml
....

You can override any of the templates below, but don't go overboard: if you can achieve the results through modifying the css, do that first since it will be easier to upgrade your site to take advantage of new features as they become available in onCourse. If you do make a mistake and need to revert to the default source file, you can find them in the /templates/_system folder. These cannot be edited, but can be copied back into the /templates/default folder.

In onCourse templates are *well-formed XML documents*.
That means that every open tag must have a matching close tag, every attribute must be quoted, and so forth.
You can override any of the templates in this handbook by simply creating a file with the appropriate name in the /templates/default folder.
Naturally if you are using more than one layout, you can have multiple sets of templates, each in their own folder within /templates.

== Page wrappers

All pages on the site are wrapped in one of two main templates.
Most pages will have PageStructure.tml wrapped around them to render menus, headers, blocks, etc.
Other web requests might be drawn inside a 'lightbox' effect and so should not have all this extra content.

=== Page Structure

Page structure is one of the few templates that is not editable.
You cannot override this particular template since it controls how the CMS integrates to the site.
But you have enough other hooks that you should not need to worry about this template.

[source,xml]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:t="http://tapestry.apache.org/schema/tapestry_5_1_0.xsd"
xmlns:p="tapestry:parameter" lang="en">
<head>
  <head t:type="ui/pagehead" title="${title}"/>
</head>

<body t:type="any" class="prop:agentAwareBodyClass" id="prop:bodyId">
  <div  t:type="ui/BodyStructure" webNodeType="webNodeType">
    <t:body/>
  </div>
  <span t:type="ui/googleAnalytics"></span>
</body>
</html>
----

=== Body Structure

Filename::
BodyStructure.tml

The important thing about the body structure is that it is called by other page templates.
So when Courses.tml wants to render itself, PageStructure is used to provide the main structure of the page.
When you reach `<t:body/>` in the template below, Courses.tml is inserted.


=== Dialog Structure

Filename::
DialogStructure.tml

This is a more minimalist page layout which is used for things that display in a 'lightbox' style dialog within the page.
It contains no javascript references, but does include the main site.css stylesheet.


== Page templates

Some of the templates you can edit are reached by a particular URL. For example, the /course/ABC renders CourseDetails.tml.
All of these top level page templates begin with something like this:

....
<html t:type="ui/pagestructure" title="Page title" bodyId="literal:DetailsPage">
....

This will render the template, wrapped with the PageStructure.tml template (to draw the main page design and layout), and give you the opportunity to override the page title and body css id.

=== Courses

Filename::
Courses.tml

URL::
/courses/[tag]/[tag]/*

URL::
/courses?s=[search terms]

Renders the course list after a user performs a search or browses the subject tags.
The parameters in the URL define the position in the subject tag tree the user is looking at, or the search parameters they used.
The first form of URL showing the list for a particular subject tag is deliberately designed to be Google friendly and encourage bookmarking.

<t:if test="isInStock">
