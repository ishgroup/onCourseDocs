== RAPT - AVETMISS Reporting in Western Australia

=== RAPT Reporting

The Resource Allocation Program for Training (RAPT) contract management system is the reporting standard used to collect data from registered private providers. AVETMISS information is extracted from RAPT to meet the local and national timetables for vocational education and training enrolment statistics reporting.

All publicly funded data reporting is submitted directly to DTWD, the State Training Authority (STA) in WA via current RAPT reporting requirements.

The RAPT formatted data is like a cut down version of AVETMISS, and includes student enrolment information like their USI.

You can export your onCourse enrolment data to the RAPT Standard for either your:

* Total onCourse training activity (enrolment and prior learning outcome data) for a date range period
* Training activity for a selection of onCourse classes (enrolment outcome data only)
* Training activity for a selection of onCourse enrolments (enrolment outcome data only)

==== Exporting all training activity to RAPT

Where your training data includes both outcomes created via students enrolling in onCourse classes and outcomes created by importing data into onCourse (prior learning), this option will collect all outcomes for all students that fall within the specified date range.


. Go to the Export AVETMISS 8 window
. Select the AVETMISS flavour 'WA RAPT'
. Enter the date range export dates
. Click 'Find', then when the results overview pops up, click 'Export'.

==== Exporting selected classes or enrolments to RAPT

If you only want to select student enrolment data for a specific class group, or for selected enrolments, you can begin the RAPT export process from either the class or enrolment window.

Start by highlighting the particular classes or enrolments in the class list view, and then go to the cogwheel and select the option 'AVETMISS 8 Export'.

Select the AVETMISS flavour 'WA RAPT', click 'Find' then click 'Export'.

=== Client Qualifications Register (CQR) Reporting

The Client Qualifications Register (CQR) is a system for the permanent recording of â€‹Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) student records from RTOs.

Therefore in the event that an RTO ceases to trade, students will still have access to their records and employers will be able to verify qualifications.

WA RTOs are required to submit information on student achievements to TAC via the CQR. RTOs need to provide data on achievement at the unit of competency and the qualification level as well as provide some minimal student information for identification purposes.

To export this data from onCourse, begin by opening the certificate window from Activity > Certificates.

Once in the certificate window you can export the required data by following the steps below:


. Run a date range the query to return the certificates for the time period you wish to export
. Highlight what you want to export from this list of certificates
. Click the Share icon, select Excel, then select 'Certificate CQR CSV export' from the list of export options and select Share.
. Your file will be downloaded to your browser
