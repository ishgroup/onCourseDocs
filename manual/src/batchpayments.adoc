=== Payment plans

Invoices have payment plans. You can learn more about invoices in our
invoices chapter.

By default invoices have a due of the day they are created. Sometimes
you will want to allow students to pay for training over a longer period
of time. Using payment plans you can set the amount of the up front
deposit and a series of dates for payment of the remainder in
instalments.

[[batchpayments-dueDate]]
==== Invoice due dates

An existing or new invoice can be converted to a payment plan by adding
payment due dates. This can be done by firstly either creating a new
invoice as mentioned in the section above 'Creating a manual invoice'
just stopping before you click on 'Save', or opening an existing
invoice. Then click on the '+' symbol at the top right side of the
payment plans / payments table for as many different payment due dates
you want to add.

lines to an invoice ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

Once this has been done you can then start editing these payment plan
lines starting with the dates you want the payments to be due. This is
done by double clicking on one of the 'today' payment due date fields in
the table and changing it to a date that you want the payment to be due
by. Then do the same for the other payment due date fields until they
are all setup correctly.

each of the payment due lines ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

Then lastly change the amounts that are due on each of these dates from
$0 to your chosen amount. This is also done by double clicking on the
relevant field in the table and editing the fee amount.

added payment due dates and amounts ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

It is important that the total of the payment plan amounts equals the
amount owing; you will not be able to save the invoice unless they
match. The 'Overdue' column in the Invoices list view will show the
total unpaid component of the invoice that is due prior to tomorrow.

You can edit the payment plan amounts and due dates at any time, for
example if you grant the student an extension to the payment plan.

[[batchpayments-payPlanTemplate]]
==== Class payment plan template

If you wish to offer a deferred payment scheme to all students in a
particular class you can set up a payment plan templates from the class
edit view you where you normally set the class fee.

This can be quite useful if you an RTO who is bound by the Standards
that limit your prepayment of fees to $1,500. For example, if you offer
a 10-week course that costs $2000, the course costs $200 per week.
Therefore, you could collect $1500 at the time of enrolment and the
remaining $500 after week seven without needing to have any protection
measures in place.

You may also like to use payment plans as part of your online marketing
strategy, by encouraging students to commit to enrolment early with a
small refundable payment (say, $100), with the remainder of the fee
becoming due on the class commencement.

The payment plan template can include an amount on enrolment (deposit)
and as many other amounts on dates relative to the start of the class.
If you subsequently adjust the class timetable and change the class
start date then the payment plan template will automatically be
adjusted. When you duplicate classes the payment plan template will also
be adjusted with the new timetable.

To create a payment plan for a class where the fee has already been set,
you need to go into the class record, click to the Budget, click and
expand the Income section then click the pencil icon next to 'Student
fee'. Edit the 'On Enrolment' amount to set the amount payable on
enrolment.

Click the + next to Payment Plan to add an additional payment after the
enrolment date. You can set this amount and the number of days after the
class starts that the payment is due. When adding payment plans, ensure
that the amounts you're adding add up to the full, expected amount of
the enrolment fee.

==== Checkout

During enrolment into a class with a payment plan, only the deposit
amount will normally be charged at enrolment. The payment field will
auto adjust to this amount, but you can manually alter it to be more or
less as you need.

If, at the time of enrolment, the next payment dates have already passed
those amounts will also be charged. So, let's take an example class with
a $1000 deposit and $500 due 7 days before the start of class. A student
enrolling 10 days before the class starts will be charged $1000 and a
student enrolling 5 days before class starts will be charged $1500.

==== Online enrolments

If a payment plan applies to the class, we suggest you make some note of
it in the class web tab, so a potential student enrolling via the web
can see what amount is payable and when. The full class fee will still
display in the class block when a payment plan applies.

in the class web info ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

When the student completes the enrolment process, the 'pay now'
component will be reduced to the deposit payable. The invoice the
student receives on completion of the enrolment process will itemise the
remaining payment components and their due dates.

[[batchpayments-script]]
==== Automating payment plans with scripts

If you have payment plan templates to create for very many classes you
may wish to instead use a script to automate the process. A simple
script might identify all classes with a fee over $1500 and then limit
the amount due on enrolment to $1500 with the remainder payable over the
duration of the class.

More sophisticated payment plan scripts can create different plans
depending on the duration of the class, the amount of the fee, whether
the class is VET or not and any other criteria.

==== Payment plan scheduled reminders

When a student is on a payment plan, you may wish to enable the default
system script 'send payment plan reminder' so the debtor is
automatically emailed a reminder 7 days before their payment is due a
link to make the payment via the skillsOnCourse portal. You can enable
this from the top menu by going to Automation > Scripts, then double
click on the script 'send payment plan reminder', click on the checkbox
'Enabled' in the top right side of the window, then Save.

image:images/payment_plan_script.png[ 'send payment plan reminder'
script ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

This default reminder will also send overdue notices to any debtor who
has an invoice (on a payment plan or otherwise) where the payment is
overdue.

This script will trigger the email template 'Payment reminder' which can
be edited by going to the Automation window and clicking into the
Message Templates section. Look for the 'Payment Reminder' template in
the section that expands open and click it.

[[batchpayments-storedCards]]
=== Stored Cards

If a contact makes a payment via the Checkout with a credit card, you
can tick the Store Card checkbox and it will store their card details
for use to process future payments.

image:images/store_card.png[ Click 'Store Card' to store the card for
later use ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

Card information is shown in the Financial section of the contact
record. If you wish to delete the stored card data, it can be done so by
clicking the Delete button next to the data in the contact record.

[[batchpayments-batchpayments]]
=== Batch Payments In

The Batch Payments In window will list out for you all of the contacts
in your system that have an invoice that has a due date in the past, and
an overdue amount on them, where the contact has a stored credit card in
the system. You can use the stored card to process the overdue payment.

If you want to see a full list of all contacts with owing payments,
regardless of whether they have a stored card, you can turn off the
'Only show contacts with a stored card' switch, which is on by default.

The total of all owed amounts currently ticked is shown in the bottom
right of the window. The total you see next to each invoice and contact

If you don't wish to process a particular payment, you can untick the
invoice and a payment attempt will not be made for that contact. You can
also open any particular contact in Checkout and apply an individual
payment in that way. Just hover your mouse over the contact name and
click 'Open in Checkout'.

image:images/batch_payments.png[ The Batch Payments In window showing 14
payments overdue ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

When you click on an owed payment, the selection will expand to show
more details of which invoices are included for each contact.

You can click on an invoice to remove it from the payment and it will
uncheck. Any checked item will have a payment attempted once you click
'Process Payments'.

image:images/batch_payments_detail.png[ This contact owes money on two
invoices, but only one will have a payment attempted on it
,scaledwidth=100.0%]

When the process is running, each payment will take its turn one-by-one
to process. You'll see a smaill processing symbol appear, and when the
process is either duccessfull or failed, the icon will change.

image:images/batch_payment_running.png[ While running, each payment will
display a 'processing' icon ,scaledwidth=100.0%]

Whether a payment is successful or failed, it will show an icon at the
end of the process indicating which payments were successful and which
ones failed. If you want to run another attempt, refresh the window.
