== Budgets

Use the Class budget feature to determine whether Classes are
profitable, predict how many more enrolments they need to break even and
create projected budgets across groups of Classes. You can compare
actuals against projected income and expenses to determine whether your
marketing planning needs adjustment in some areas of your course
delivery.

. Go to the Budget section in the Class window. Here you can see a list
of income and expenses for the Class, plus a summary of the Actual and
Projected income and expenses.
. If you have already added a tutor and added a payroll amount, you may
already have a cost assigned for the tutor wage.
. If you've added the tutor but don't see their wage, add their tutor
wage manually. Click the + button next to the Budget heading, then click
Tutor pay and select the tutor you wish to add, you need to have already
assigned the tutor to the Class. You can then define the rate and any
associated oncosts. Note that for the tutor wage to be automatically
calculated, the tutors name has to be ticked for the sessions they are
teaching in the Class timetable.
. Additional expenses and income can also be added by clicking the +
button and selecting the option you're after. Expenses may include items
like room hire, student textbooks and advertising charges. Some expenses
may be considered 'sunk', that is, they are incurred even if the Class
is cancelled.
. The Actual summary will show the income and expense given the current
students enrolled in the Class. To set an estimate, or budget, type the
number of expected students in the Projected field. The income and
expenses will then be calculated accordingly.
. From the Class list window, a range of budget reports are available to
assist you with evaluating your program profitability. The Budget
Details report shows line by line detail of the budget you have created.
The Budgets report will show a summary of the actual and projected
income and expense for a selection of Classes. Access them by clicking
the Share button.

=== Adding and Editing Budget Items

Additional income and wages for a Class can be recorded via the budget
tab so the profitability of a Class can be accurately calculated for
your actual and projected enrolments. Clicking on the + sign on the top
right hand side will bring you three options:

* Expense/Cost
* Income/Funding
* Wages

For each item you wish to add to the budget, you can choose if the cost
is calculated based on an hourly amount, a per student contact hour
amount (per student per hour), per enrolment, per session or fixed. As
these reference items change e.g. when another student enrols or when
you add more time to the Class duration, the budget items will
automatically adjust.

Expense items can be capped at maximums and minimums for the Class, have
GST applied as needed, have oncosts associated with them (e.g. super, on
top of wages) and be deemed as sunk costs.

A sunk cost is the cost you will incur even if the Class is cancelled,
for example you may considering advertising as a sunk cost. Using sunk
costs is important in a detailed budget as it will assist you in
determining if it is financially viable to run a Class even if the sunk
costs have not been met.

,scaledwidth=100.0%]

As you continue to add items to the Class budget, such as the tutor
wage, room hire fees, student fee income, applicable government funding
income, resourcing costs and others, the actual and projected summaries
will update automatically.

If you need to delete a budget line item, simply highight the entry and
the click on the trash can icon for that line. If you wish to edit a
line entry, simply double click on the entry to bring up the edit
window.

==== Budget as calculation tool

An important part of the budget calculations are the projected enrolment
numbers you have estimated. This number is an estimate of how many
students you believe will enrol in the Class and is used to calculate
the figures under the 'Projected' column in the budget section.

The budget will then calculate the enrolment number required to go ahead
(meet your refundable costs) and the enrolments required to profit (meet
your refundable and sunk costs). This information is displayed in the
budget section of a given Class.

[TIP]
====
If you do not enter any expense items for a given Class budget, the
information on the number of enrolments required to make a profit that
is found in the budget section will be hidden.
====

==== Tracking Discounts via the Budget

As well as reflecting all fee income within a given Class, the budget
section allows you to track discounts. With each discount type listed as
a line item within the budget.

When defining the paramaters of a given discount, you can also enter an
estimated percentage of students within a given Class who are likely to
take up this discount. This figure is set within the general section of
the discount and is identified as the default forecast take up.

The default forecast take up of a given discount will be applied to all
Classes that have that discount, but if you wish to adjust the take up
percent figure on one Class, you can do this by double clicking on the
discount line item within the budget section of that Class.

image:images/forecast_uptake_for_discount.png[ When setting the values
of a given discount, you can enter a default forecast take up amount
,scaledwidth=100.0%]

Once a discount has been assigned to the Class and you have entered a
figure for the projected number of enrolments that are likely to be
received for a given Class via the budget section, the budget will
calculate the discount amount based upon the percentage of projected
enrolments that are likely to take up that discount.

The dollar value of discounts given during the enrolment process will be
visible in the budget section against their corresponding discount
strategy.

If you give a manual discount during enrolment, the balance will be
deducted from the total income field, but not visible in the discounts
section of the budget section as it is not linked to a pre-exisiting
discount strategy.

=== Linking manual invoices income to the class budget

You can create a manual invoice for income earned through other means
(e.g. government funding) and link it to a classes budget. Any invoice
linked to a class will be counted toward the class income automatically,
and the pre-paid fee liability rules of this class will also apply to
the invoice.

To create the manual invoice, open the 'Invoice' window. This can be
found by typing 'Invoices' into the main search on the Dashboard.

Once you have the invoice list view window open, do the following:

* Click on the '+' symbol at the bottom right side of the window
* Add information such as who the invoice is being sent to, whether you
want the invoice date and due date to be a different date, whether you
want to add a customer reference
* Once these details have been filled in, click in the '+' symbol next
to invoice lines
* A sheet will appear that will let you link this invoice to a class.
You will have to fill in information such as Title, Quantity, Price,
Income account and, under 'Assign to Budget' what course and class code
it's linked to.
