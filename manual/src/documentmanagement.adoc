[[documentManagement]]
== Documents in onCourse

onCourse provides an effortless way to manage your documents. Documents can be uploaded to onCourse and linked to Courses, Classes, Enrolments, Contacts, Tutors, Students, Sites and Rooms. Because all documents are version controlled you will never lose any historic information, making RTO compliance easy.

Document management in onCourse can be used for lots of purposes:

* Displaying images and other content on your website
* Storing compliance documentation such as tutor resumes and qualifications
* Maintaining a history of assessment and other enrolment related compliance
* Distributing information to tutors through the skillOnCourse portal
* Distributing assessments and course material to students

[[documentManagement-Adding]]
=== Adding new documents

You can add new documents directly in the edit view from many places in onCourse, in two different ways:

* Drag-and-drop the file from your desktop into the window
* Browse your system by clicking the plus symbol next to the Documents header

image::images/documentManagement/adding_attachments.png[title='Adding a document in the edit view of a class']

==== Drag and drop

If the document is one you haven't yet uploaded to your onCourse system, you can add it and attach it to the current record simultaneously by simply dragging and dropping the file from anywhere on your computer on to the browser tab. The file will be uploaded and associated with the currently viewed record, you can name it and select a privacy setting, and then save it.

==== Browse

While viewing the record you wish to attach the document to, click the + button next to the Documents section heading. You will now be given a choice to find an existing document or upload a new file.  Click on the 'Browse' button to find the file on your machine or, if you've already uploaded the file, type the name you gave it when you saved it.

image::images/documentManagement/attach_document.png[title='Attaching a new file']

Once a file has been added or selected it will take you to another window. If the file is new you can start entering additional information like a name, description, tags and setting <<documentManagement-accessRights, permissions>>. If the file was already uploaded, then you can only view this information. You have to go to the document record in the Documents window to edit these details.

image::images/documentManagement/attach.png[title='Uploading a new file']

[[documentManagement-Attaching]]
=== Attaching existing documents

If you wish to attach an existing document (one which has previously been uploaded in onCourse) to a record, simply go to that record and click the + button next to the Documents heading, then search for the name given to the document when it was uploaded, and select it from the list of results.

When attaching a document to a record you'll be able to set its permissions, as well as any tags and give it a description. For a closer look at how permissions work, <<documentManagement-accessRights, click here>>.


[[documentManagement-listView]]
=== Document List View

The Document lst view is the main view of the Documents window. It functions the same way as other list views in onCourse do, allowing you to click a record to highlight it, use find-related, search queries and cogwheel functions.

[[documentManagement-deleteDocumentRecord]]
=== Deleting a document record

Due to their nature, you cannot directly delete document record from onCourse, you 'mark' them for periodical deletion. This gives you the opportunity to review documents pending deletion to ensure that you aren't getting rid of anything important.

To mark a document record for deletion, from the documents list view highlight a single document record. Click the cogwheel and select 'Move to Bin'.

When a document that is in the bin is highlighted, this cogwheel function will change to read 'Restore from Bin'. 'Restore from bin' will remove the record from pending deletion.

Documents marked for deletion are deleted when their 'modifiedOn' date is more than 30 days old.

[NOTE]
====
Deleting a version of a document is different to deleting the document record entirely. Please see the <<documentManagement-Versioning, 'History'>> section below for how to delete a version of a document.
====

[[documentManagement-Editing]]
=== Editing document records

Once documents have been stored in onCourse you can edit their properties in the Document edit view. The edit view shows you a summary of the document, including a preview, tags, the name, document permissions and document history.

image::images/documentManagement/document_list_view.png[title='Document list view in 3 column mode']

Open the document record by double-clicking on the record.

[[documentManagement-EditingView]]
==== Document record view

There are a number of fields and settings in the document record. You need to give the document a name in onCourse (this is not the file name), a description, set who can view it and where they can view it. You can also see the document's history.

image::images/documentManagement/multiple_attachments.png[title='General overview of the document']

If a document is marked for deletion, it will display the words 'Pending Deletion' across the screen.

[[documentManagement-Versioning]]
=== History

image::images/documentManagement/edit_attachment_history.png[title='Version history of the document']

When you use the 'Upload New Version' function, onCourse will keep a history of all versions of files you upload. Just click 'Upload New Version', then select the file from your local machine.

You can select which version of the document is used by selecting the tick box next to the documents under the 'History' heading.

You can view the historical document by clicking the four-arrowed icon.

You can also completely delete older or unused versions of documents by clicking the bin icon next to the file name under the 'History' heading. Document versions deleted this way are deleted permanently and cannot be recovered.

[NOTE]
====
Deleting a version of document is not the same as deleting the document record entirely. For instructions on deleting the document record please see <<documentManagement-deleteDocumentRecord, this section above.>>

[[documentManagement-specialDocuments]]
=== Contact pictures

Pictures added to contact, student and tutor records are stored automatically in the onCourse documents section.

If you open a contact record (company, tutor, student) in edit view double-click on the image at the top left, you can add your own photo of that person. A file dialog will appear and you will be able to choose a photo to add. It will be automatically resized to a thumbnail size before being stored.

As a matter of privacy, any image documents uploaded this way are automatically set as private, and need to have their permissions changed before the image will display publicly on your website.

[[documentManagement-accessRights]]
=== Access rights

Each document has multiple settings that will tell the system who can view it and where they can view it. You can see information at a glance about who can see the document, and where, by looking in the blue 'Who can view this document?' box. This will change dynamically based on your selections in the boxes below.

Attached To::
Here you'll see a list of the records that this document is attached to, which will also affect where the document displays both in onCourse and elsewhere, depending on permissions e.g. if a document is attached to a Course but both the Shared in portal and Shared by link switches are off, then the document will only appear in the course record of onCourse. If the Shared by link and Shared with website visitors switches are on, then the file will also display on the relevant Course page on your website.

If the document is attached to one record only, an 'Attach only to this record' checkbox appears here. Check this to restrict this document to a single linked record. You'll also see related link icons next to each entity. Click these to see a list of associated records in that entity. If Skills onCourse 'Shared in portal' is on, you'll see a list of contacts who can view the document in the portal.

Skills onCourse::
This box has a switch called 'Shared in portal' which, when active, allows the document to be viewed within the portal. Who can view this document in the portal is controlled by two factors; which records the document is attached to, and the checkbox settings in this permissions. the two checkbox options are 'Show to tutors' and 'Show to students'. 'Show to tutors' cannot be deactivated, but 'Show to students' can be switched off to show to tutors only.

If the document isn't attached to any record but this permission is active, then the document is visible to EVERYONE with a portal login. If the document is attached to a class or course then the document will be visible in the portal to all permissable tutor and student records associated with that class/course.

You can send the class tutor or an enrolled student a link to the document inside the portal to allow them to access it e.g. https://www.skillsoncourse.com.au/portal/resources to access all their resources, or https://www.skillsoncourse.com.au/portal/class/5040367 to access the resources attached to a specific class, where 5040367 is the class id in the onCourse web database.

Shareable Link::
When active, this permission allows anyone with the generated link to access this file. If the document isn't attached to any records, then only users with the link will be able to see it. Click 'Copy Link' to copy it to the clipboard for linking in a message or email.

image::images/documentManagement/shareable_link.png[title='The shareable link permission switched on']

All documents, when opened in onCourse, will open with a link, however only documents that have 'Shareable Link' permissions activated can be shared in this manner. If you share a link to a document without this permission the user will get an 'access denied' error.

Website::
Switching on this permission allows the document to be viewed on the website, and works as a pair with the Shareable Link permission. It is only viible when the document is either not attached to any record at all, or atached to a single course record.

It's important to note that just because this permission is on doesn't automatically mean the document will be displayed on the website; this also depends on the type of record the document is attached to. If the record isn't attached to any record, but referenced using the shareable link, then it will only be visible if the link is placed within a rich text field and this permission is active.

image::images/documentManagement/permissions_website.png[title='An example of permissions showing the website sharing section']

The below example shows that this record is attached to 7 sites records, 1 asessment record, 3 contact records and 1 course. The shared in portal switch is on with both tutors and students checkboxes checked, but the shareable link is not active. As shown in the 'Who can view this document' box, you can see that this means only onCourse admin users and some students and tutors, specifically those contacts the document is attached to and in the portal for any tutor or student associated with the course '20 Great Ways to Promote Your Businesss Online'. The document will not appear on the Course's website page unless the shareable link is active.

[[documentManagement-deleted]]
=== Bin

Documents sent to the bin are marked for permanent deletion. The bin is emptied at a random time every Sunday, and will remove any items that have a modifiedOn date of over 30 days old.

Documents added to the bin DO NOT have their associations with other records removed, and can be restored by simply clicking the 'Restore' button with the record itself.

image::images/documentManagement/deleted_document.png[title='The "Deleted" switch for this document is on. Turn it off and save to recover the document.']

[[documentManagement-deletedNotification]]
==== Get notified about documents pending deletion

You can be notified of which documents are marked for deletion the following Sunday by enabling the Documents for Deletion script. This will send out an email (called 'Documents for deletion') that contains the file names of each document due to be deleted. Each document will be hyperlinked back to the document record in onCourse so you can easily restore it if you wish.
