    <title>Document Management</title>
    <para>onCourse provides an effortless way to manage your documents. Documents can be uploaded to onCourse and linked
        to Courses, Classes, Enrolments, Contacts, Tutors, Students, Sites and Rooms. Because all documents are version controlled you will never lose any historic information, making RTO compliance easy.</para>

                        When you open this document from inside onCourse, you can send the URL link
                        for these documents to other users and they will open the attachment in a
