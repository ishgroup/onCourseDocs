		<title>Message Templates</title>
		<para>The best way to define a message template is that it is a predefined and pre-constructed
			message that are sent out manually or automatically when on an event has occurred. An
			event that sends a message is defined by a <link xlink:href="scripts.html"
			>script</link>. An example would be that a student has just enrolled into a class via
			the website or through the office, so the 'send enrolment script' will email the
			'Enrolment Confirmation' template to the enrolling student. </para>
		<para>Inside the message template, fields like ${enrolment.student.contact.firstName} in the
			template will insert the relevant data from onCourse into the message.</para>
		<para>onCourse makes it easy to access and update your templated messages by keeping them in the
			one place, in the Automation window under Message Templates. You can use the templates
			as they are or you can personalise them to your specific needs and requirements. You can
			also create additional templates, and where necessary, accompanying scripts, specific to
			your business requirements.</para>
		<para>onCourse default templates include both a plain text and HTML version of the template. If make changes to the template wording you
			should change both versions of the template for consistency. The receiver's mail client preferences will determine if they receive the
			plain or HTML version of the message.</para>
		<para>The content of the plain text and HTML templates should be the same, the HTML template
			just includes additional information for the styling of the message so it renders inside
			email clients.</para>
		<para>Be careful when changing the names of the message templates. If the template is used by a
			script, you will need to change the reference to the template name in the script
			also.</para>
		<para>The default templates included in onCourse are listed in the sections below.</para>

			<title>Email headers and footers</title>
			<para>The default ressage template list includes a header and footer template, which contains
				both a plain text and HTML layout.</para>
			<para>These templates are used inside every other default email template.</para>
			<para>If you look at the template text you'll see that most of the data used to create
				these templates is drawn from the AVETMISS preferences tab settings. Even if you
				don't report AVETMISS you should complete these fields so the data used in your
				templates is correct.</para>
			<para>The HTML version of the header and footer can insert your businesses logo and use
				your style guide colour scheme with some minor adjustments. If you do not have a web
				designer available you can contact ish to request custom changes to these, and other
				templates.</para>

			<para>To understand the entities, objects and attributes available to use in building a template, we recommend you download Cayenne

		<section>
			<title>Writing Groovy in email templates</title>
			<para>The templates are written in a programming language called Groovy which is a Java based language that can run inside the
				onCourse application. An overview of the language can be found at <link xlink:href="http://groovy.codehaus.org"
					>http://groovy.codehaus.org</link>. </para>
			<para>The onCourse API documentation, explaining the database structure is available <link
					xlink:href="http://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/api/">on the onCourse
					support page</link></para>
			<section>
				<title>Examples of Groovy in the templates</title>
				<para>Both onCourse email templates and scripts are written in Groovy. onCourse templates are created using the <link
						xlink:href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates">GStringTemplateEngine</link>, storing the template files within the
					onCourse database.</para>
				<para>The key to creating a successful template is to ensure you begin with the most appropriate onCourse entity for the task. This
					will make the process of locating and joining other data from the database straightforward.</para>
				<para>If your template is to send information to a student in relation to a particular enrolment, then the enrolment entity would be
					the correct starting point, rather than the student or the contact.</para>
				<para>The entity name you select as the starting point of the template determines the path you use to join to attributes of other
					onCourse entities. For example if you were starting with the entity enrolment and wanted to insert the student's first name, you
					would join the enrolment to the student, then the contact as below:</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">${enrolment.student.contact.firstName}</programlisting>
				<para>However if you wanted to show the same information from a template linked to the invoice entity you would join via the
					enrolment, as the invoice is linked directly to the payer contact, who might be a different person to the student. This example
					would give me the first name of the student enrolled in the class linked to an invoiceLine on an invoice.</para>
				<programlisting>${invoice.invoiceLine.enrolment.student.contact.firstName}</programlisting>
				<para>Where this join would give you the name of the invoice payer contact.</para>
				<programlisting>${invoice.contact.firstName}</programlisting>
				<para>For some fields you may wish to add formatting, such as showing a date in a particular style. The first example shows a short
					date format and the second shows a date time and long date format. This page outlines all the <link
						xlink:href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/format/simpleDateFormat.html">Java Simple Date formats</link>
					available.</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">${invoice.createdOn.format("d/M/yy")}
${enrolment.courseClass.startDateTime.format("h:mm a EEEE d MMMM yyyy zzzz")}</programlisting>
				<para>The results you wish to display may be the result of a calculation of field values. This example subtracts one field from
					another.</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">Total Paid ${invoice.totalIncTax.subtract(invoice.amountOwing)}</programlisting>
				<para>Inside a template you may wish to include some content that is displayed based on the property of an attribute from the joined
					object. A simple example of this is only displaying a label and value if the value is not null in the database, like the optional
					customer reference field.</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">&lt;% if (invoice.customerReference) { %>
Your reference: ${invoice.customerReference}
&lt;% } %></programlisting>
				<para>A more complex example is this condition which switches the content of the enrolment confirmation based on whether the class
					is self paced or has sessions.</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">&lt;% if (enrolment.courseClass.startDateTime == null) { %>
Start: On enrolment
Expected duration: ${enrolment.courseClass.expectedHours ?: "not specified"} hours
&lt;% } else { %>
Start: ${enrolment.courseClass.startDateTime.format("h:mm a EEEE d MMMM yyyy zzzz")}
End: ${enrolment.courseClass.endDateTime.format("h:mm a EEEE d MMMM yyyy zzzz")}
&lt;% } %>                </programlisting>
				<para>You can also create a loop inside a template to iterate through a list of joined entities. To list the invoice lines joined to
					an invoice you would start with the entity invoice and for each invoice line display the Title, PriceTotalIncTax and Description.
					More examples of collections can be found on <link xlink:href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Collections">the Groovy website.</link>
				</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template"> &lt;% invoice.invoiceLines.each { %>
${it.title}    ${it.priceTotalIncTax}
${it.description}
&lt;% } %></programlisting>
				<para>To display an image in a email template you can first of all add the image to the onCourse
					document management system then add the following syntax to the email templates
					html body:</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">${image "imagename"}</programlisting>
			</section>
			<section xml:id="emailTemplates-portallinks">
				<title>Adding links to portal pages in the templates</title>
				<para>Inside email templates, you may wish to include direct links to parts of the student
					portal, for example to allow students to access their class resources without
					having to log in using the format</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">portalLink(target, timeout)</programlisting>
				<para>This format creates a signed URL that is accessible until a certain date. If no date or
					time is defined, the URL will be accessible for 7 days. A timeout can be
					definded as an absolute date (format is 'yyyy-MM-dd') or as a number, which is a
					relative date from the day the email is sent e.g. 14.</para>
				<para>Records that are linking to objects, such as specific class pages are written
					without speechmarks, where links to portal URL pages are defined as strings by
					writing them inside speech marks.</para>
				<para>If a student click on a signed link, it will limit them to accessing that page
					within the portal. For example, if you include a standard unsubscribe link in
					your emails like:</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">To remove yourself from the waiting list and unsubscribe to these notices, 
please visit ${waitingList.student.getPortalLink("subscriptions")}</programlisting>
				<para>and the user clicks on the menu item in the portal to access their outcome results, they
					will be returned to the login screen. In this way, the security of the portal is
					maintained, and the documents or timed links sent can't easily be distributed to
					others or exponse potentially confidental information.</para>
				<para>If sending from an email template linked to an enrolment, example options available
					include:</para>
				<programlisting language="groovy-template">${enrolment.student.portalLink(courseClass)} -> link to class page
${enrolment.student.getPortalLink(enrolment)}  -> link to class page
${enrolment.student.getPortalLink(invoice)}  -> link to one invoice
${enrolment.student.getPortalLink("USI")}  -> link to USI portal page
${enrolment.student.getPortalLink("timetable")}  -> link to the timetable portal page
${enrolment.student.getPortalLink("results")}  -> link to results portal page
${enrolment.student.getPortalLink("subscriptions")}  -> link to the subscriptions portal page
${enrolment.student.getPortalLink('/class/' + enrolment.courseClass.willowId + '/resources')} → link to the resources page of the class</programlisting>

			<title>Sending a manual message using a template</title>
			<para>While many emails may be sent automatically based on their associated <link xlink:href="scripts.hmtl">scripts</link>, template emails
				may also be sent manually, or new templated created just to send manual messages. This allows you to resend important information
				like a Tax Invoice that may have been misplaced by the student or filtered as junk mail. The send option will use the contacts
				current email address, so this tool can also be used to resend messages that bounced due to an incorrectly entered email.</para>
			<para>Template emails can be sent using the appropriate cogwheel option 'send custom email'. The custom emails available are those
				linked to the same entity. For example, in the Enrolment Confirmation screenshot above you can see it is linked to the entity called
				Enrolment. This makes the template available in the enrolment window cogwheel list. </para>
			<para>You can send a email template from the following list views</para>
