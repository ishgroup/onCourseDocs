			<para>Welcome to ish onCourse. To help you use onCourse comfortably, this section will
				demonstrate the various windows, lists, records and other icons you'll see. onCourse
				is designed to be and flexible and easy to use, and you can have it set up to help

			<title>The onCourse Dashboard</title>
			<para>The dashboard is the opening window of onCourse; it is the first thing you will see on your
				screen after you successfully login. The dashboard is made up of a three-column view
				window with a collapsible, global navigation quick access column containing two
				sub-tabs on the left (Favourites &amp; Latest Activity) Enrolments &amp; Revenue in
				the middle, and onCourse news on the right. There is also a logout button, a button
				to change your visual themes and, in some cases, and an Upgrade to onCourse Pro
				button for anyone using the free version of the software.</para>
			<para>Columns can be resized by hovering your mouse over one of the cut-off lines, then clicking
				and dragging either left or right to decrease or increase the size of the column.
				You can also resize the window by hovering your mouse over the bottom-right corner,
				or the left or bottom edges of the window, then clicking and dragging to resize it.
				The global navigation column can be collapsed by clicking the 'x' in the
				top-left.</para>

		<para>The onCourse record view appears once you open (double-click) on a record in a list

			shown can vary a lot.</para>
		<para>To see a record view, go to a window like "classes" and double click on a record in the list
			view. The screenshot below shows you what to expect in a typical class record view,

					at and replace the data with the next record in line. Note that this could take
					a few seconds as it is bringing up a lot of data from the record. It's a faster
					way than closing the current record view and opening another record view. If you

					forwards.</para>
