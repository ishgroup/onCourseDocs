=== Kiosk Mode for Sites

The onCourse kiosk mode is designed to show on a monitor or tablet the classes that are running at a particular site or room today. A large screen in a foyer or tablet outside each room is an inexpensive way to always show up to date information to tutors and students.

Clicking on the TV icon in the top right-hand corner of the https://demo.cloud.oncourse.cc/site/204['Sites' edit view] will generate a URL that looks like 'https://www.mycollege.com.au/site/kiosk/111' where www.mycollege.com is the URL in your general preferences College Website URL and 111 is the unique site ID.

Once you have clicked on the link to open the URL and can confirm it is displaying as expected, enter this into your display device. Once you have set the URL it will update itself regularly to show current information at all times.

The data shown in kiosk mode will be the real time data of today's classes that are either in progress, or yet to commence. The data is sorted by start time order, and then alphabetically. As classes complete, they automatically drop off the list.

When there are no classes scheduled for the day, or all the day's classes are complete, both the site and/or room kiosk view will display "There are no more classes scheduled for today."

[[kiosk-rooms]]
=== Kiosk Mode for Rooms

A kiosk view is also available for each room of a site, to display the classes running today. This is the URL you would access if you wish to display the details for all classes scheduled in a particular room, for example, to display on a tablet located near the room's door.

Click on the TV icon in the top right-hand corner of the https://demo.cloud.oncourse.cc/room/385['Room' edit view] to access the URL for that room. The URL will be your college site appended with something like `/room/kiosk/469` where "469" is the onCourse unique ID for the room.

Like the kiosk view for a site, the room view will only show classes in progress and scheduled for today. As the class session completes, it will drop off the list automatically.

[[kiosk-customise]]
=== Customising the kiosk

You can customise the design of the kiosk in three ways:

==== Adding a logo

Log into your website webDAV interface (see the design handbook for details) and put your logo at the path `/kiosk/img/logo.png`. This will place your logo in the top left corner of the kiosk.

==== Adding your own styles

Put a css file at '/kiosk/css/kiosk-local.css' and override any of the default styles with your own.

==== Changing the html

The kiosk is just another tml file like all other parts of your site, so you can make more radical changes by changing the kiosk pages and components through webDAV.

You can learn more about using WebDAV here: https://www.ish.com.au/onCourse/doc/design/#_editing_your_site_via_webdav
