	<title>Tutor pay</title>
	<para>In this chapter, we cover how to set up standard rates of pay for your Tutors, how to
		include Tutor costs within the overall class budget, confirming Tutor attendance / hours
		worked and how to generate Tutor pay from onCourse. </para>
	<para>Before you work through this section, you need to ensure you have already set up a class
		with a timetable. You will also need to ensure you have created a Tutor record. </para>
	<section xml:id="payroll-payRates">
		<title>Setting standard pay rates</title>
		<para>onCourse allows you to map standard pay rates to Tutor types. These are used by
			default, but can be overridden per class as needed. Some standard Tutor type names are
			included by default, but these can be changed or deleted as needed.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Types of pay rates available in onCourse</title>
			<para>The rate type of a tutor pay is it's multiplier answers the questions 'how many
				times will the tutor be paid this amount' and 'when will it be payable'? All of the
				multipliers are relative to other information about the class that has been defined
				elsewhere, such as the timetable and number of enrolments. As the multiplier value
				changes, the amount payable to the tutor changes automatically.</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para><emphasis role="bold">Fixed</emphasis></para>
					<para>A fixed pay rate is a flat amount of pay that is payable to the tutor on
						the first day of the class. A fixed amount may be used to record an
						allowance that is provided in addition to an hourly or session based pay, or
						in the case of a short class where the tutor is paid a fixed amount. The
						fixed type of pay has no relation to the tutors teaching schedule in the
						class timetable, or number of students enrolled. A tutor who is eligible for
						a fixed pay type does not need to be assigned to any of the class sessions,
						but does need to be added to the class tutor tab. There is no multiplier for
						this pay rate - it is a once off payment.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><emphasis role="bold">Per session</emphasis></para>
					<para>A per session rate of pay is attached to sessions in the class timetable
						where the tutor is assigned. A per session rate of pay is payable regardless
						of the duration or payable time set for the session. A per session pay rate
						can not be paid in addition to a per timetabled hour pay rate for the same
						tutor involved in teaching a class. If more sessions are added to the
						timetable, the amount payable for the tutor will automatically
						increase.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><emphasis role="bold">Per enrolment</emphasis></para>
					<para>A per enrolment rate of pay pays the tutor an amount multiplied by the
						number of active enrolments in the class at the time the payroll is run. A
						per enrolment rate of pay can be paid in addition to a per session, or per
						timetabled hour rate and may be used for additional allowances, such as an
						assessment marking allowance. Like fixed types, per enrolment types are
						payable on the start date of the class, and can be paid to tutors not
						attached to deliver any of the class sessions e.g. an assessor.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><emphasis role="bold">Per timetabled hour</emphasis></para>
					<para>This is the most common type of pay rate used, and is based on the tutors
						attendance at a session i.e. the tutor is assigned to the session, and the
						session duration is 3 hours therefore the tutor is paid for their rate per
						timetabled hour x 3 hours. There is also an additional 'Payable Time' field
						for each session that can override the session duration for payroll purposes
						e.g. to pay to an additional hour to allow for opening and closing a venue,
						or to pay less time than the session duration, to account for unpaid breaks.
						As the timetable is changed, the amount payable to the tutor will
						automatically increase or decrease. Fixed payroll wage types and per
						enrolment types can be paid in addition to a per timetabled hour rate to a
						single tutor in a class.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><emphasis role="bold">Per student contact hour</emphasis></para>
					<para>This is a less frequently used type. It is a rate that is paid per student (active
						enrolment) per hour of delivery. A rate set for this type is multiplied by
						both the number of active enrolments at the time the payroll is run x the
						number of timetabled hours for each session. It is more commonly used for
						the provision of government funding than it is for payroll. Per student
						contact hour pay lines are calculated as a single wage line due on the start
						of the class and can be used in combination with other pay types. The
						'Payable time' field in the timetable also sets the hours multiplier for
						this rate.</para>

		<section><title>Managing employees vs contractors</title><para>As the onCourse payroll

			<para>If you are
			exporting the tutor payslip data from onCourse into your primary accounting system to
			complete the final stages of the payroll process, you will want to be able to clearly
			identify your employees and contractors.</para>
			<para>In the onCourse tutor contact record, on the tab labelled tutor, you can enter a payroll
				reference number. This number is shown in the list of payslips generated.
				Often,employees and contractors will have different types of identification numbers,
				for example all employees may have a unique ID from the primary payroll system used
				to match them on import, and contractors have the label 'contractor'. In the payslip
				list view, this makes employees and contractors easy to identify.</para>

			<para>You may then select your employee payslip records and export and finalise them, locking the
				payslip from further adjustment and locking the attendance and approval data for the
				included pay lines.</para>
			<para>Employee payslips may be exported from onCourse and marked as finalised on a
				fortnightly basis, but you also need to keep a track of your contractor invoices  -
				have they been issued to you as expected, and do they match the amount you budgeted
				for?</para>
			<para>In this case, having time and attendance payslips generated for your contractors gives you
				the data you need to compare against the invoice you receive. These contractors may
				not invoice you on the same cycle as employees are paid, even though onCourse will
				create the payslip data for them on the same cycle. However, by having the payslip
				data in onCourse with a status of 'new' provided you don't finalise that payslip,
				each fortnight when you run the generate pay process, the contractor payslip will be
				added to.</para>
			<para>This way, over time, you may have eight weeks, or four pay cycles of contractor data in a
				single payslip which matches their eventual invoice. When the invoice is received,
				you can compare it to this payslip, and the finalise the payslip that matches your
				invoice.</para>
			<para>You may choose to defer some pay lines if they aren't included on the invoice received, and
				that is fine, it means they will come back again the next time you run a pay cycle,
				but this time on a new payslip.</para>

		<title>Payroll Questions and Answers</title>

				<question>
					<para>Can I have multiple tutors teaching, and being paid for the same
						session?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>Yes, you can assign many tutors to a session. Each tutor is attached to the class with
						their own payroll type and rate, and this is the rate that will apply to
						them as they teach the session. Each tutor attached to the session will be
						paid their rate multiplied by the session's payable time, in the case of per
						timetabled hour pay rates.</para>
					<para>If the tutors attached to the session have different payable times due to them i.e. only
						one of the tutors is paid an extra hour for opening and closing the venue,
						then use the tutor payroll confirmation on the class attendance tab to vary
						the payable time for each appropriate session for that tutor only.</para>
					<para>Tutor payable time can be either increased or decreased from the scheduled
						session time.</para>
				</answer>
			</qandaentry>
			<qandaentry>
				<question>
					<para>I have a five hour class, with one tutor teaching for the full five hours,
						and other teaching only for two of those hours. How do I record their
						different payable times?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>There are a few options available here, depending on how you wish to
						present the class timetable to the tutors and students attending. One option
						is to break the single five hour session into a three hour and two hour
						session, and assign the five hour tutor to both, and the two hour tutor to
						their session only. The class budget will then show the correct expenses for
						tutor wages. The benefit of this approach is that both tutors will see the
						times they are expected to be teaching in their timetable. Your onCourse
						website will slightly alter the display of the class details block when you
						have broken a day into multiple sessions so it is clear to potential
						students what the delivery structure looks like and what the class start and
						end times are.</para>
					<para>A second option would be to keep the single five hour session and have
						both tutors assigned. The two hour attending tutor, instead of having a per
						timetabled hour rate could have their wage line overridden to a per session
						rate, that you manually worked out to be the per timetabled hour rate x 2.
						This will give you the correct class budget payroll expenses, but the two
						hour tutor will see in their timetable that they are 'teaching' a five hour
						session. </para>
					<para>A third option would be to keep both tutors assigned as above, but use the attendance
						marking function for the two hour attending tutor to mark their payable time
						to be 120 minutes only. This option will generate the correct payroll for
						the tutor, but the budget will show that you expect to pay them for five
						hours of attendance, not two, so will be overestimating the class costs. The
						tutor timetable will also show that the two hour tutor is 'teaching' a five
						hour session.</para>
				</answer>

			<qandaentry>
				<question>
					<para>A tutor called in sick and was replaced by a casual. How can I reflect
						this so they are not paid for that class session?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>You can either untick the tutor from the session who didn't attend or mark their
						attendance record with a red cross (rejected for payroll). Either option
						will prevent a per timetabled hour or per session payroll type being
						generated for them for that particular session.</para>
					<para>You can then add the casual who filled in for them to the class and just
						assign them to that session and ensure the appropriate wage line is added to
						the budget for them (it's best to untick the option 'add selected tutor to
						all class sessions' when you just want to add a casual replacement tutor to
						a single session)</para>
				</answer>

				<question>
					<para>Our award requires the tutors to be paid for a minimum of two hours per
						session, but the session is only one and a half hours long. How can I pay
						them correctly?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>The payable time field in the session on the timetable is the first option
						for overriding the pay, so you could increase this from the default session
						time of 1 hr 30 mins to the two hours you want the tutors to be paid. This
						would then show in the budget the correct costs for the tutors wage.</para>
					<para>Alternatively, you could override the tutor pay rate from the normal per timetabled hour
						option to a per session option where you manually worked out the 2 hour
						rate. This would also keep the budget accurate.</para>
					<para>The other option would be to use the session by session payable time value, and increase
						their payable time from 90 mins to 120 mins, so the correct pay was
						generated, however it wouldn't affect the budget projection, which would
						keep their estimated pay amount being multiplied by 1hr 30 mins per session.
						This is a better choice if you had two tutors assigned to the session and
						only one of the tutors was affected by this award condition.</para>
				</answer>

				<question>
					<para>Our award requires tutors to be paid an additional 20% of their normal
						hourly rate when they work 4 hours or less. How can I calculate this?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>There are a few ways you could approach this change of rate.</para>
					<para>One option would be two have two different roles which each had two
						different per timetabled hour rates e.g. Tutor Part Time, $40 per timetabled
						hour and Tutor Casual with a rate of $48 per timetabled hour. You would then
						choose the appropriate role and rate when you assign the tutor to the class,
						knowing it's daily session duration and if they are being paid at the Part
						Time or Casual rate.</para>
					<para>The second option is to use a single rate, but for the sessions with a 4
						hour or less duration, to add 20% more time than the session duration to the
						session payable time. 20% of an hour of payable time is 12 minutes, so if
						they are working for 3 hrs, you could pay them the Part Time rate for 3 hrs
						and 36 min payable time to get 3 hours of payable time at the Casual
						rate.</para>
					<para>Keeping in mind that a tutor in onCourse has a role and rate which applies to all of
						their sessions for that class, so using an increase in the payable hours is
						a good option if the session duration, and appropriate pay rate, varies
						during the class. For example if the first 9 sessions of the class are 6
						hours long, so the tutor is paid at the Part Time rate, but the last session
						is an exam and only 3 hours long, so the tutor should is paid at the higher
						per hour Casual rate for this session only. This is where changing the
						payable time to 3 hrs and 36 mins would be most appropriate.</para>
					<para>A final option, if trying to calculate the difference in payable time to
						arrive at the new rate is too complicated, is to add a second wage line to
						the budget for that tutor for a fixed rate of the extra amount they should
						be paid. In this example, for the final 3 hour exam session, the tutor would
						be paid an additional $32 on top of their normal hourly rate. Remember that
						if you choose this option, the fixed amount will show up in the payroll run
						for the first class session, as all fixed rate types are payable on class
						commencement. You can use the untick option for that line in the payslip to
						remove it on every payslip generated until the pay run when you want it to
						be paid, but this requires a little more manual intervention. </para>
				</answer>
			</qandaentry>
			<qandaentry>
				<question>
					<para>Our tutors are paid a fixed daily rate when they work between 6 and 8
						hours. How can I set this up?</para>
				</question>
				<answer>
					<para>onCourse does not have a concept of a daily rate. A per session rate may
						be an appropriate way to express this provided your class timetable has only
						one session per day.</para>
					<para>If single day in the class timetable is often broken into multiple
						sessions, expressing the daily rate as a per timetabled hour rate would be
						more appropriate. For example, if the daily rate was $300, you may choose to
						express this as a per timetabled hour rate of $50 per hour, and you would
						then ensure all classes with a daily duration between 6 and 8 hours have the
						payable time per day set to 6 hours.</para>
					<para>If your teaching day started at 9am, finished at 4pm and the day was
						broken into 3 x 2 hour sessions with gaps between them for breaks, the
						default payable time would be the same as the session time, so you wouldn't
						need to alter anything and the daily rate would be calculated
						correctly.</para>
					<para>If your teaching day started at 9am and finished at 5pm with a single
						session having an 8 hr duration, you could adjust the payable time to 6 hrs
						so the daily rate would calculate correctly.</para>
