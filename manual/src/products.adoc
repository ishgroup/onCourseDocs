== Other products

In addition to enrolments in classes you can also sell:

* Memberships
* Vouchers
* Products

In this chapter we'll focus on the last of these items: product sales. For more information on memberships, see <<concessions, Concessions and Memberships>> chapter, and for more information on vouchers see <<vouchers, the Vouchers chapter>>.

Products in onCourse are a simple way to supply additional, defined items during an enrolment sale. onCourse does not manage a stock inventory or the shipping of products. It is expected that most products will be supplied to the student in person when they attend the class. Each product record can have its own data collection rule set, this allows for better control over data collected at the point of purchase for different types of products.

=== Purchasing a Product online

A product can also be purchased online provided its status allows it. For a product to be available online, the status field on its product record must be set to 'can be purchased in office and online'.

After a user adds a product to their cart and proceeds to checkout, they complete any set marketing questions and then get to the summary page. They will be able to set the quantity of the product they're purchasing and the checkout price will update automatically. This is also where any set data collection forms will be filled out.
