=== Using reports

onCourse comes prepackaged with a large range of reports. You can use them as is, or copy and modify any of them to suit your needs. Advanced users can also create brand new reports from scratch.

==== Printing Reports in onCourse

The first thing to be aware of when attempting to print a report is that you must be in the right onCourse list view to print the expected report. For example, Class roll is a report available from the class list. You cannot print this report from inside the class record, only the class list view.

From each list window, click on the Share icon, the select 'PDF' to see the list of available reports,

image::images/PrintIcon.png[title='Share icon in the Sites list view']

All reports are printed to a PDF file which you can save to your computer, email, or print to a printer on your network. Your computer will need to have a PDF reader installed to create and view the report.

For exports to excel, XML or other formats, look at <<importExport, our exports chapter>>.

Before you print a report, you will usually need to collate your data by running a query on it first.
For example, if you wish to print the class rolls for all the classes starting this week, you will need to do an advanced query for classes starting from today, to the last day of the week. For more information on search queries, check our <<search, search chapter>>.

The share window provides an alphabetized list of all reports available via the given window. Select the relevant report and a summary description and print preview (if it has been printed before) is provided of the highlighted report. This description will also clarify whether the report prints in Portrait or Landscape format.

In the print dialogue, you will be asked if you want to print selected or all records. A record count will be given for each option. Choosing 'selected' will print the results you have highlighted manually, while choosing 'all' will print the report for the one or more records you have selected in the list.

[[reports-background]]
=== Print Backgrounds

onCourse printed reports can be set up with a defined background. These backgrounds must be created as a PDF document that is then imported into onCourse via the PDF Backgrounds section of the `Automation` window.

Generally, you will have a standard 'letterhead' style background, available in both portrait and landscape modes that can be used as the print background to common reports like invoices, enrolment confirmations and class rolls. You might also have some special backgrounds for certificates and other formal documents. Put all your graphic elements on these backgrounds such as signatures, logos, compliance icons and watermarks. It is easier to add these elements to the background than to the report itself.

[[reports-createBackground]]
==== Creating a backgrounds

Use your favourite page layout tool. Indesign, Quark, Word, Pages or any other tool which can create high quality PDF output will do fine. Make sure you set up the page size and orientation to match your report.

If you create a single page PDF, that background will be used for all the pages of your report. If you create a two page PDF, the first page of the PDF will be used as the background for the first page of the report and the second page of the PDF will be used for all subsequent pages. It is common to create a two page PDF with letterhead on the first page and a blank page for the follow-on.

[TIP]
====
Many of the built-in reports have 30mm header space. If you can keep your header within that area, you'll not have to adjust the standard reports to fit.
====

[[reports-addNewBackground]]
==== Adding a background to onCourse

Once you have created the print backgrounds for your reports, you can now import those PDF backgrounds into onCourse and attach them to their relevant reports. You only need to import each report background once.

Report Backgrounds are managed within the Automation window, under PDF Backgrounds:

. In onCourse, from the Dashboard, search for 'Automation' then click it open the window.
. Scroll the left-hand column until you see 'PDF Backgrounds'.
. Click the + button next to the header, this will create a new background record that you can upload your background PDF to.
. Name your new background, then click the 'Upload New Version' button.
. Find where you saved your PDF file, click to highlight it, then click Open.
. You will now see the filename appear just below the button. Click Save.
+

If you click back into your record, you will now see that it shows a preview of the background PDF (as shown above).

[TIP]
====
When printing, the report will default to the last background you used for that report.
====

[[reports-choosingBackground]]
==== Choosing a Print Background

You can choose a print background in one of two places:

. You can set it globally as a default background within a PDF report record itself, or
. You can set it at the time you print a report from within onCourse. This is simple as setting the background on the print view screen from the PDF Background drop down box.

To set a global default background for a report:

. Go to the Automation window and scroll the left-hand column until you see PDF Reports
. Click into the PDF report you wish to set a background for
. In the record that opens, make a selection from the PDF Background drop down box, then click Save

image::images/select_default_background.png[title='Manage backgrounds via Reports window']

[[reports-preview]]
==== Background Previews

You may notice the Preview sections within the PDF Reports and PDF Backgrounds records. The preview window shows you a preview of how the current PDF Report will come out with the background that's currently selected.

IMPORTANT: Previews will only generate after a report has been printed at least once, and the 'create preview' tickbox was checked.

To ensure you create a preview:

. When preparing to print any report, ensure the correct background is selected
. Ensure the 'Create Preview' tick box is ticked.
. Check this the next time you print by making sure the preview box has an image in it.
