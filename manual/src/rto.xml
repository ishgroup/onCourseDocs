		<title>Understanding how outcomes are attached to enrolments</title>
		<para>When a VET course is created, qualifications, accredited courses, skillsets, modules and units of competency are set at the
			course level. More information about setting up VET courses is available in the <link
				xlink:href="courses.html#courses-VET">courses chapter</link>. Classes for the course inherit the
			units set at the course level. You can see these units in the Training Plan on the

		</mediaobject>
		<para>When a student enrols in the class, the units of competency attached to the course
			become the outcomes attached to the student's enrolment. The start and end date of class
			become the start and end date of the outcomes, unless you choose to define different
			dates in the training plan. The settings on the class VET tab become the default
			settings for each outcome for that class, but can be changed on an outcome by outcome
			basis. Within the class level outcomes can be changed or set, but can not be deleted and
			new outcomes can not be added here. </para>
		<para>You can see the outcomes that have been assigned to each student in the class on the
			outcomes tab, in the student's record on the enrolment tab, and on the enrolment record
			on the outcomes tab.</para>
		<para>Via the student's enrolment record, outcomes added in error can be deleted from the
			enrolment record and additional outcomes can be added. Adding or deleting outcomes needs
			to be done per enrolment where training and assessment is taking place at your RTO. For
			outcomes gained in learning outside of onCourse, prior learning records can be imported,
			or manually added to the student's education tab.</para>
			<para>Once outcomes are linked to certificates, a laurel icon is displayed next to the outcome.
			Once the certificate is printed and issued, the outcomes become locked in the system and
			greyed out so they can't be edited. If the certificate is later revoked, the outcomes
			can be edited again.</para>

			<title>Cancelling VET enrolments</title>
			<para>Sometimes when you cancel a VET enrolment, it is because it was created in error and you
				want to delete all the outcomes. At other times, often when the training is funded,
				you want the enrolment cancelled to make another position available in the class,
				but have the outcomes retained for reporting purposes.</para>
			<para>When you cancel an enrolment, by default the checkbox option retains any outcomes that have
				had a status set, and deletes any outcomes with a status of 'not set'.</para>
			<para>If, at this point, no outcomes have had their status set (for example, the student
				was enrolled into the wrong class) then all outcomes will be deleted. However, if
				this was a funded enrolment and you wanted to retain all the outcomes to later mark
				as 'withdrawn' then you can uncheck this option.</para>
			<para>If you are cancelling an enrolment where you have already set all the outcomes,
				e.g. all set to withdrawn already, leaving this option checked will delete
				nothing.</para>
			<para>If you have set outcomes on an enrolment record and want them deleted, and not
				retained, then you will need to either set them back to 'not set' before cancelling
				the enrolment, or you can manually delete them from the enrolment record after
				processing the cancellation.</para>
			<para>If you have created a certificate that includes outcomes from the enrolment, they will
				always be retained on the student's outcome and can not be deleted manually, even if
				the certificate has been revoked.</para>

		<section>
			<title>What are outcomes?</title>
			<para>A students outcome is the record of their engagement with a Unit of Competency or
				Module from a training package or accredited course. Outcomes are often reported to
				government through processes such as AVETMISS and must meet certain validation
				rules. Primarily, an outcome records if a student has passed or failed their course.
				The outcomes available for selection are as follows:</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member> Competency achieved/pass (20)</member>
				<member> Competency not achieved/fail (30)</member>
				<member> Withdrawn (40)</member>
				<member> Recognition of prior learning granted (51)</member>

						<question>
							<para> Why would I want to change the start and end date of an outcome?
							</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> If a class falls over a collection period (usually a calendar
								year) and some students have been assessed and passed already, they
								can be reported with an end date in the current year. The students
								who have not yet been assessed, and have end dates in the following
								year will be automatically exported with outcomes of 70. You do not
								need to set the outcome to 70, then come back and change it when the
								results are received. </para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> What is the funding source field for? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> In some types of classes, overseas fee paying students may be
								attending, as well as Australian fee-paying students, and Australian
								government funded students. By setting the appropriate funding
								source at the outcome level, you report the correct student contact
								hours to your funding body, without having to move student
								enrolments into different class groups. If you deliver CSWE
								programs, where this often an issue, there is more information
								available here about how to set up your courses and outcomes.
							</para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> I report my statistics to ACE and also need to report my non-accredited course
								outcomes. How do I do this? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> 'outcomes' are also created for general enrolments and VET flagged non-accredited
								courses. On export, they will automatically be set as type
									<emphasis>81 - Non-assessed enrolment - Satisfactorily
									completed</emphasis>. You still need to manually set the
								outcomes for students who do not complete or attend the class as
									<emphasis> 82 - Non-assessed enrolment - Withdrawn or not
									satisfactorily completed</emphasis>
							</para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> What are reportable hours? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> There is some disagreement between different state funding bodies
								on what number should appear in this field. Generally, it is
								understood to be the nominal hours, as defined by NCVER tables. The
								nominal hours set for each module will be the default reportable
								hours reported in your NAT00120 file. Non-accredited courses report
								the classroom hours in this field. If you prefer to report the
								classroom hours in this field, you can set this in the class VET
								tab, however you will need to do this BEFORE enrolling students,
								otherwise you will need to change the hours outcome by outcome. In
								some cases, you may need to modify the nominal hours reported for
								students being funded under particular programs, and you should do
								this in their outcome record. </para>

						<question>
							<para> A student who enrolled in one of our VET classes has completed

						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>Open the student record and go to the education tab.  In the section called 'prior
								learning' you can add additional outcomes as needed. Units completed
								at another training organisation should be marked as <emphasis> 60 -
									Credit transfer</emphasis> and their nominal hours are not
								counted towards your colleges annual delivery. On the 'documents'
								tab of the prior learning record, you can also add attachments, and

						<question>
							<para>A student has changed their mind about an elective choice, or
								wishes to do an additional unit. How do I add or change their
								record?</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>Find the enrolment record for the student and open the outcomes
								tab. Here you can change, delete or add additional outcomes as
								needed. To change an outcome from one unit to another, double click
								on the outcome record and change the module code. Modules for which
								you have already issued certificates for can not be edited and
								you'll see that they are greyed out. </para>
							<para>Using the plus or delete icon in the top right hand corner allows

			<section>
				<title>Manually adding prior learning records</title>
				<para>The education tab of a student record is comprised of four sections - enrolments, prior

					system reference number e.g. the course code or enrolment code from the previous
					system and optional descriptive notes.</para>
				<para>On the second tab, outcomes, you can manually add one or more units of
					competency or accredited modules to the prior learning record. It is important
					you add start and end dates to the units of competency, and a valid outcome
					status here if you want to report them for AVETMISS or use the unit to create a
					certificate. If you are adding units completed at another RTO, you should record
					the outcome status as 'Credit Transfer'.</para>
				<para>If you scan any documents, such as a copy of their Certificate, you can add

			<para> Some colleges who deliver CSWE courses run open English language programs at different

				then assess the students and selects appropriate units from the CSWE curriculum for
				them to work towards. Some students in a class group may be working towards a single
				unit, while others may be working towards multiple units. Some students may be fee
				paying, some may be funded under various government programs. Some students may
				enrol in a class two or three times before attempting assessment against a CSWE unit
				and some students may not wish to be assessed at all. All of these circumstances

					reporting. This section has been deliberately made complex to assist our clients
					who are obliged to report AVETMISS for both VET delivery and non-VET
					delivery.</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Qualification Hours - These are the nominal hours set by NCVER for the
							qualification. Often, this field is left blank, which is acceptable for
							AVETMISS. You can also add the nominal hours to the qualification
							yourself in the Qualification table. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Nominal Hours - The nominal hours field in the class is the total of
							the nominal hours of the units of competency assigned to the course.
							While the nominal hours for each unit are usually set by NCVER, you can
							override them or add them where they are missing in Module/Unit of
							Competency record. You can edit these values when you attach units to
							courses by double clicking on the unit record. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Classroom Hours - The total hours you have defined as scheduled activity by setting
							sessions or by defining the minutes per sessions and number of sessions
							on the General tab. This is not reported as part of AVETMISS for real
							VET outcomes - it is for your information only. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Reportable Hours - These are the hours that will be reported against
							each enrolment in the NAT00120 file. They default to the nominal hours
							of the units attached to the course. If there are no nominal hours set
							in the unit, i.e. in a non-VET course, the nominal and reportable hours
							will default to the classroom hours. You can override the reportable
							hours field to the classroom hours or any other number that you wish to
							export in it's place for non-VET courses only. For VET courses, you can
							also override the reportable hours in each outcome, if they differ from
							the unit nominal hours. NOTE: If you have created a class which has
							units of competencies assigned and not set nominal hours for these
							units, your contact hours and reported hours for these outcomes will
							always be zero. Reportable hours based on delivery hours only populate
							non-VET outcomes.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Student Contact Hours - This totals the reportable hours in the
							outcomes attached to the class. This can also be simplified to number of
							students x total class nominal hours for most cases, but in VET classes,
							some students may have different units assigned or different reportable
							hours for their units. SCHs are often used by funding bodies to measure
							delivery. If you have not set nominal hours in the units of competency,
							your student contact hours will calculate to zero. If your classes'
							course does not have units of competency assigned to it e.g. it is a
							non-VET course, the student contact hours will by default equal the
							classroom hours x number of students, unless you override the reportable
							hours field in the class.</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>The report Class funding will provide you with summary information, per
					qualification, per funding code of how many student contact hours you have
					delivered over the classes selected for the report. This can be used to check at
					various points during the year, the number of hours you have delivered that
					compare to your funding targets. </para>

		<title>Courses by Cluster</title>
		<para>How to set up qualifications that are delivered by internal clusters where units of
			competency overlap</para>
		<para> Clusters, in this case, refers to an internal grouping of units of competency that a
			college delivers to break up a qualification into teaching-focused groups of units.
			Sometimes one unit from a qualification may be delivered across multiple clusters, and a
			student must successfully complete the assessments in each cluster to achieve competency
			in the unit. For example the Qualification Certificate IV in Training and Assessment has
			12 units in total, but the four Environment units are assessed in each cluster. The
			course is delivered in three clusters and each cluster has a fee that applies to it. </para>
		<section>
			<title>Creating the Qualification</title>
			<para>Create a new course and attach all the units that you deliver as part of the
				qualification. This is the formal enrolment where you will record the student's
				completion of outcomes once assessment has been sufficiently completed across your
				various clusters.</para>
			<para>This is the course that you will advertise on your website, so make sure you
				include the full course description and information about how you deliver the
				program.</para>
			<para>Next, create a class for this course, entering the dates, student fees and venue
				information. Details on how to create a class is available here. Web enable this
				class so students can enrol. </para>
			<para>You may choose to set up this class as an 'application fee enrolment' and advise
				the students of the full fee within this class description. Do this by setting the
				class fee as the amount you wish them to pay to apply, and ensure your information
				explains what the approval process involves. You will need to contact students who
				apply and inform them of their success or otherwise, and organise payment of the
				full course fees. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Creating the clusters</title>
			<para>The cluster courses that you create are for your scheduling and management
				purposes only. They will not be advertised online, as you will enrol students in
				these classes as appropriate.</para>
			<para>The clusters that you create are not VET courses - do not attach the qualification or units
				of competency to these records. You can put details of the units and content covered
				in the description if you wish.</para>
			<para>Set up each course and class with the assigned rooms, tutors and sessions</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Enrolments and Payment</title>
			<para>As onCourse will invoice students class fees, you can allow students to make full
				payments or part payments at the time of enrolment.</para>
			<para>For example, you could set the full fee on the first class and track students as
				they make payments towards this total amount. Alternatively, you could set up
				multiple classes with fees attached, so students are only invoiced for a portion of
				the course fee each time they are enrolled in a new cluster.</para>
			<para>In the example below, the full qualification has an application fee of $100, paid
				online. Once the student's enrolment has been accepted, they are invoiced $900 for
				the first cluster, and $500 for each of the subsequent clusters, until a total of
				$2000 has been paid.</para>

		<title>Traineeships and Custom Training</title>
		<para>onCourse has the ability for courses and classes to be created under the traineeship model,
			where one student is often completing a work-based course of study, managed via their
			employer, with regular on-site visits for assessment.</para>
		<para>The custom class function available through Quick Enrol allows users to create these
			programs for students.</para>
		<para>First you need to ensure you have created a course containing the expected units of
			competency for the traineeship, <link xlink:href="courses.html#courses-VET">see here.</link> This could be
			just the core units, or the core units and the expected electives. The actual electives
			chosen by each trainee can either be added or changed later.</para>
		<para>Once the course has been created, you can then create a private booking in quick
			enrol. See the <link xlink:href="privateBookings.html">Private bookings chapter</link> You can set the assessor during this
			process, as well as schedule the first assessment/training session, or wait until later

		<title>VET Qualifications and other Certificates</title>
		<para>onCourse includes the AQF recommended templates for full Qualification Certificates,

			meet your own style guides and content preferences. Certificates can only be generated
			from units that are recorded as part of onCourse enrolments or Prior Learning records.
			If you wish to include prior learning or credit transfer units, you will need to add
			these outcomes to the student's record before you create the certificate.</para>
		<para>By generating the certificate record in onCourse you will have created the data required to
			meet the ASQA Standards for RTOs 2015 - Standard 3. The certificate list is your
			Certificate Register. A certificate record you create is available in the certificate
			table in onCourse for printing, AVETMISS export and re-printing. Once created, the
			certificate record can be edited and amended or even deleted prior to printing, but
			after the record is printed it becomes locked in the database to ensure an accurate
			record of your issued certificates are retained.</para>
		<para>The associate outcomes that make up the certificate also become locked in the
			database, so they can not have their outcome status changed, or be deleted after the
			certificate has been issued.</para>
		<para>Every certificate record created is issued a unique certificate number, which is
			printed on the certificate face. The same number series is used for Qualifications and
			Statements of Attainment. The records will begin at 1 and automatically increment each

		<para>If you are required to generate and submit AVETMISS data, any certificate record you

							Statement of Attainment or Qualification/Skill Set certification for the
							student in the onCourse Certificate table.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>The issuing of the VET Certificate to the student via upload to the portal using the 'send

							the enrolment record, uploads it to the portal and sends the student an
							email notice where they can click and retrieve their certificate without
							a password (for 7 days) or retrieve by entering a password past 7
							days.</para></listitem>
				</orderedlist>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Enabling the automatic VET Certificate creation script</title>
				<para>Like most included scripts, the 'automatic creation of VET Certificates' script is
					disabled by default. If you wish to automate this script you will need to enable
					it in the File > Preferences> Scripts menu.</para>
				<para>The script checks at 4am every day check for outcomes which have been modified in the
					previous 24 hrs. If any outcomes attached to the enrolment are not yet marked,
					the enrolment is skipped for certificate creation. When all outcomes have a
					status, then the certificate creation process is triggered. This means if
					outcomes are marked over time, the certificate will not be created until the
					last outcome of the enrolment is marked.</para>
				<para>It is important to note here that an outcome with an indeterminate status like a 70 or 90
					will trigger the certificate creation process. There are almost no cases where
					you should enter this value in an onCourse record - allow the AVETMISS export
					runner to set these values as needed.</para>
				<para>For students with at least one successful outcome, create the certificate record
					(Statement of Attainment or Qualification, based on the 'Satisfies complete
					qualification or skill set' flag at the course level). If the outcome is already
					joined to a certificate, this script will not create a new certificate
					containing that outcome. </para>

		<section>
			<title>Manually creating certificates in bulk</title>
		<para>If you wish to create certificate records for the whole class group, we recommend creating
			the certificate records from the class cog wheel option. If at the course level, you
			checked the option 'Satisfies complete qualification or skill set' on the VET tab,
			enrolled students will be automatically generated either the qualification or skill set
			certificate for which the course is for. If you have not selected this option,
			Statements of Attainment will be generated. This option only selects outcomes from the
			student's record that have been created due to their enrolment in this particular
			class.</para>
		<para>Additional validation rules apply to this creation process to ensure that only student's who
					have achieved the outcome of the course are issued with the correct
					certification. For example, where a course is marked 'Satisfies complete
					qualification or skill set' on the VET tab, and the student has one or more unit
					with a non-successful outcome, a Statement of Attainment will be generated
					instead of a Qualification or skill set certificate. Where no outcomes have been
					marked as successful, no Statement of Attainment will be created.</para>
		<para>If you wish to create a certificate based on a single, or group of student's
			enrolments, then you can do the same thing from the enrolment window, by highlighting an
			enrolment or group of enrolments and using the cog wheel function to create the

			<para>Certificate records in onCourse can either be full Qualifications, Statements of
				Attainment working towards a Qualification, Statements of Attainment with no
				qualification reference, or a Statement of Attainment for a skill set.</para>
				<para>If you have created the certificate from the course or enrolment cogwheel process,
					onCourse will select the most appropriate certificate type based on the course
					settings and the student's outcomes. For example, if a student enrolled in a
					complete qualification has one or more outcomes not set, a Statement of
					Attainment, rather than a Qualification will be created for them. You may need
					to add the missing outcome status and then change the certificate type to
					'qualification or skill set' prior to printing.</para>
				<para>You should confirm the certificate record that was created automatically is of the correct
					type prior to printing as this can not be changed afterwards.</para>
			<para>It is worth noting, that as with the course set up process, onCourse does not contain any
					reference data to determine if a full Qualification is valid or not. It is up to
					you as the certifying RTO to ensure when you create and issue a certificate
					record you have deemed a qualification, the student has achieved sufficient
					outcomes those outcomes are attached to the certificate record.</para>
			<para>You can also choose to attach unsuccessful outcomes to the certificate record, for
				example, outcomes where the student has withdrawn or been deemed not yet competent.
				These outcomes will print on the accompanying transcript that is generated when you
				print a certificate, but will not print on the Statement of Attainment certificate
				face. Only successful outcomes will print on the certificate face. </para>
				<para>If you wish to alter the Awarded on date from the default date the record was
					created, or the Issued on date from the default date the certificate was
					printed, you should do this prior to printing. These fields can be changed after
					printing if you notice the dates are incorrect, and the certificate
					reprinted.</para>
				<para>Add any public notes that you wish to display on the certificate face, such as
					information about the funded program that this certificate was delivered under,
					or the language the training was delivered in if not English, need to be
					manually added during the pre-printing verification process. There is no
					automatic population of this data from any where in onCourse. You can add
					information to this field, and the private notes field, after printing if you
					require, and reprint the certificate.</para>

			<section>
				<title>Certificate record verification during printing</title>

						the transcript is more than one page long, the second page of the template
						will be used for the subsequent pages printed.</para>
				
				<para>If you are printing Qualifications in bulk, onCourse will recognise when the student
						record has changed to the next student and therefore apply the first page of
						the PDF background again as this is a new Qualification. </para>
				<para>When creating a background for a Statement of Attainment report, only a single page
						background is required. On occasion, Statements of Attainment may contain
						reference to more units that can fit during printing on a single page. In
						this instance, the report will be split into multiple certificate pages.
						Each certificate number will be appended with a page number on printing e.g.
						certificate 472 may display as 472/1 and 472/2 if multiple pages are
						created.</para>
					<para>If you are manually printing a range of Statements of Attainment and
						Qualifications to the printer at a time, and you have different backgrounds
						for these reports, you need to print them in two groups - once group the
						Qualifications with their background chosen, the next group the Statement of
						Attainments with their background chosen. If you use the onCourse automated
						script to run the print and issue process, the correct background will be
						selected automatically.</para>

	<title>Certificate signatory name and title</title>
				<para>You can update the signatory name for your Certificate reports via the

					name and title of the nominated signatory name in the one line. Go to
						<guimenuitem> File - Preferences - General Preferences</guimenuitem>and
					click on the AVETMISS tab, the 'Full certificate signatory name' field you need
					to edit is under 'Optional' on this tab. Whatever content you add to this field,
					will appear automatically within your Certificate Reports, unless your custom
					report has this information hard coded into it.</para>
				<para>If you require a different layout for the signatory fields i.e. two names, name and title
						on separate lines or embedded digital signature, we recommend you put all
						this data in the background and remove the signatory details from the
						onCourse report templates.</para>

				<title>Skills Set Statement of Attainment Certificate</title>
				<para>A skill set is a relatively new concept of a fixed grouping of units of competency to meet
						an industry need, that are less units than completing a whole qualification.
						Skill sets are defined by Training Packages and available on
						training.gov.au, and their names and codes are automatically downloaded into
						onCourse, along with units of competency and qualifications. You could think
						of a skill set as a mini qualification. In onCourse, they are treated
						similarly to a qualification, as in a student has to be competent in all of
						the skill set outcomes to be issued a complete skill set.</para>
					<para>Like a qualification, completed skill sets are reported in the AVETMIS
						NAT00130 file. Normal Statements of Attainment are not reported.</para>
					<para>If the course has been defined as being a 'complete qualification or skill set', and the
						student has successfully completed all the units of competency, then
						onCourse will attempt to create a skill set certificate for the
						participant.</para>
					<para>If you are manually creating a skill set certificate, you need to select
						the option inside the certificate window 'qualification or skill set' rather
						than Statement of Attainment, even though a skill set is a type of
						statement.</para>
					<para>On training.gov.au, each skill set includes suggested words for the
						Statement of Attainment. If you wish to add these words to your printed
						certificate, be sure to copy and paste them into the Certificate public
						(printed) notes fields.</para>
					<para>Below is an example of a Skill Set Certificate record, and a printed copy
