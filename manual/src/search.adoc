=== Introduction

onCourse has powerful tools for searching across every piece of data you have collected. You can search in lists, perform basic and advanced searches on any attribute of the data and use these searches to write scripts and reports. In this chapter we'll start from the simplest tools and then show you the more advanced possibilities that onCourse allows.

[[search_findAnything]]
=== Dashboard search

The main Dashboard has a search bar where you can type in almost any type of data from a record, including a name, course code, class code, even an invoice number, and it will be shown in the search results.

If you click on a search result, that record will open in a new window unleass you are searching for a contact. Clicking a contact record search result will open that contact in the contact insights panel. You can learn more about that in our <<gettingStarted-contactInsights, contact insights>> section of our manual

image::images/find_anything.png[title='Find Anything will help you find almost anything within onCourse quickly']

[NOTE]
====
This is not the same as the Search function in list views.
====

[[search-listView]]
=== List Views

Every list view has a search panel across the bottom where you can type out simple search terms, like a name or course code, or queries to search on certain parameters.

Typing into the search bar will retrieve all records that match your input across certain fields.
For example, in the Contact list, the text you enter will be found in first name, last name and email address fields. Simple search terms will automatically wrap in quotes. You can also type more complex queries into this field using the <<search-advanced,Advanced Query Language>>.

[[search-findRelated]]
=== Find related records

Find related records is one of the most powerful tools inside onCourse, let you quickly jump from window to window, finding records related to groups of other records. The function icon is located next to the advanced search in each list view in onCourse.

For example, to locate all the employers of all the students aged 18 to 25 in the last three months of VET programs to send the Employer Satisfaction Survey to you can start by searching for all classes with a particular tag or use the advanced search on VET course flag. Once you have those classes, you can highlight those delivered in the last three months, and select from the find related icon 'Enrolled students'.

image::images/search/find_related_records.png[title='Finding the related Course record for the highlighted Class']

Once the student list has opened, you can search that list of results for students aged 18 to 25. The list view that has opened is in a special mode called 'custom selection' which you can see in the window header bar. This means other searches or filters you run on this window are only inside the special set of results you have created as a list.

With the reduced list of students, you can use the find related icon to select contacts related as an employer. From this new window, you can use the cog wheel to send a message to the student's employers.

[NOTE]
====
Find related can only be run on a max of 1000 records at any one time
====

[[search-advanced]]
=== Advanced Query Language (AQL)

You can construct more powerful search queries using the onCourse query language. When clicked on, you'll notice the search bar expands and shows numerous options for you to select from a drop down box. These selections are used to construct queries, which can be used to find either simple or complex sets of data. It might seem intimidating at first, but understanding the logic of this feature will help hone in on finding exactly the right data you need, and using the drop down boxes takes a lot of the guesswork out of this.

image::images/search/advanced_query_fields.png[title=The advanced search query options appearing in the drop down box.]

The small bookmark icon shows you whether or not your search query is valid. When the search is empty it appears grey, when you're using an accepted query it'll display in green, and when using an invalid query it'll display in red. When the query is good and the bookmark is green, you can click the bookmark icon to save your search. On saving it, the filter will appear in the left-hand column under 'Custom Filters'. Just choose if you want it visible for only you or everyone who uses your system, give it a name then hit the save icon that appears next to it.

You can also use AQL in some sub-lists, like when adding a set of classes to discounts, or when adding a Corporate Pass to a voucher type.

A simple query consists of a field, followed by an operator, followed by a value:

....

                title starts with "Apply"

....

In the above example, the field is 'title', the operator is 'starts with', and the value is 'Apply'.
Searches are context sensitive to the screen you are viewing e.g. in the Unit of Competency list, this query will show you records beginning with 'Apply'.

Two or more queries can be linked together with conditional operators.

....

                title starts with 'Apply' and nationalCode starts with "B"

....

In this example, 'and' is the conditional operator that combines the two separate queries. In this case, using 'and' means only records that satisfy both queries are returned.

image::images/search/searchOperator.png[title='An example of a simple query using the onCourse query language']

[[search-advanced-fields]]
==== Fields

When you click into the search box, a drop-down list of available _fields_ will appear. The fields that are available to use in queries will change depending on which record type you are searching on. You can also search for custom fields by typing the custom field key associated with the custom field you want to call.

image::images/search/advanced_query_fields.png[title='Query parameters are listed in a simple,context-sensitive drop-down box for you to choose from']

[[search-advanced-operators]]
==== Operators

In your query, you will want to compare the field with some value. The type of comparison is defined with an _operator_. Each operator can be written as a word in full or as the short symbol.

EQUALS or =::
Finds records where the field matches the value exactly. This operator is not case-sensitive.
+
....
createdOn = today
....
+
....
nationalCode EQUALS "ABC"
....


NOT EQUAL or !=::
NOT EQUAL finds records that do not match the input value.
+
....
deliveryMode != ONLINE
....


LESS THAN or <::
LESS THAN returns records where the value is less than the input value.
+
LESS THAN can also be used with EQUALS to return records where the value is less than or equal to the input value.
+
....
enrolmentCount < 10
....
+
....
enrolmentCount <= 9
....


GREATER THAN or >::
GREATER THAN returns records where the value is greater than the input value.
+
GREATER THAN can be used with EQUALS to return records where the value is greater than or equal to the input value.
+
....
age > 17
....
+
....
age >= 18
....


BETWEEN or ..::
BETWEEN ( .. ) is used to specify a date range. BETWEEN ( .. ) will return records where the specified attribute occurred or was created between the set dates.
+
....
createdOn in 01/01/2018 .. 01/02/2018
....
+
BETWEEN can be used with a star closure ( * ), placed either directly before or after the date. See below for the correct syntax; placing the star and BETWEEN before the date will find all relevant data from before that date, while placing them after will find all relevant data after that date.
+
....
createdOn not * .. 01/01/2018
....
+
Both the above and below queries will show you the same data, all records created after 01/01/2018. The top query asks all records created before this date to be excluded thanks to the 'Not' operator, while the bottom query asks for all records created after this date to be shown thanks to the 'In' operator.
+
....
createdOn in 01/01/2018 .. *
....


IN::
IN will display any data that fits into the input data set.
+
A set is denoted as a list of items, where each element of the set is separated by a comma. In the below example, this query will return and display any data that has a confirmationStatus as either _NOT_SENT_ or _DO_NOT_SEND_.
+
....
confirmationStatus in (NOT_SENT, DO_NOT_SEND)

enrolment.student.id in (10,11,12)
....


[ ]::
Square brackets are a shorthand to search for the record id (the primary key in the database) in a list, denoted by [ ].
+
....
enrolment.student[10,11,12]
....
+
This query is equivalent to:
+
....
enrolment.student.id in (10,11,12)
....


{ }::
Curly brackets allow you to reference a record attribute multiple times without needing to retype the full path to that attribute.
+
The following query can be simplified using curly brackets:
+
....
outcome.enrolment.status == REFUNDED and outcome.enrolment.student.contact.lastName == 'Smith'
....
+
Here's the simplified version:
+
....
outcome.enrolment{status == REFUNDED and student.contact.lastName == 'Smith'}
....
+
Notice how the path from 'outcome' to the 'enrolment' attribute is only typed out once. The query inside the curly braces is in the scope of the 'enrolment' attribute.


BEFORE::
BEFORE can be used in conjunction with dates (or date-specific keywords, like 'today' or 'tomorrow') to return any requested data created or set before the input date.
+
....
createdOn before today
....


AFTER::
AFTER can be used in conjunction with dates (or date-specific keywords, like 'today' or 'tomorrow') to return any requested data   created or set after the input date.
+
....
createdOn after today
....

CONTAINS::
CONTAINS returns any data where the specified field contains/matches the input.
+
....
name contains "Gardening"
....

STARTS WITH::
STARTS WITH returns any data where the specified field contains data that starts with the input.
+
....
name starts with "Cooking"
....

ENDS WITH::
ENDS WITH returns any data where the specified field contains data that ends with the input. Note: this cannot be used in richtext fields
+
....
name ends with "Expert"
....

NOT::
NOT reverses the returned value of all of the previous operators.
+
For example, 'code not contains "Gardening"' with return all courses that have a code that does not contain the term 'Gardening'
+
....
name not like John
....
+
....
name not contains "Gardening"
....
+
....
name not starts with "Cooking"
....
+
....
name not ends with "Beginners"
....


HASHTAG or #::
The HASHTAG ( # ) operator will return records that are tagged with the specified tag in onCourse E.G. if you have a tag named Health and Care, and another named Training, and you wanted to find records that use either tag, you'd use:
+
....
#Health_and_Care or #Training
....


FILTER TAG or @::
The FILTER TAG ( @ ) operator is used to as shorthand to call a custom query or other filter that has been saved.
+
For example, imagine the following query is saved with the name _kids_:
+
....
Age <= 12
....
+
_@kids_ can then be called in the construction of other queries
+
....
@kids and isMale is true
....
+
is equivalent to Age < = 12 and isMale is true

LIKE or ~::
The LIKE (~) operator is used to search a field for a specific pattern.
+
There are two special wild card characters used with the LIKE operator:
+
. _%_: the percent sign is used to represent any amount of characters (including zero)
. ___: the underscore is used to represent exactly one character
+
Examples of the LIKE operator with wild card characters:
+
....
name ~ "a%" name like "a%"
....
+
finds any record that has a name starting with "a"
+
....
name ~ "%a"
....
+
finds any record that has a name ending with "a"
+
....
name ~ "%ab%"
....
+
finds any record that has a name containing "ab"
+
....
name ~ "_a%"
....
+
finds any record that has a name with "a" as the second letter
+
....
name ~ "_%_%_%"
....
+
finds any record that has a name with at least a length of 3 characters
+
....
name ~ "a%b"
....
+
finds any record that has a name starting with "a" and ending with "b".



[[search-advanced-conditions]]
==== Combining queries

OR::
....
name contains "Gardening" or code starts with "GAR"
....


AND::
....
startDateTime = tomorrow and successAndQueuedEnrolments >= minimumPlaces
....


( )::
Use brackets to specify the order in which query fragments are executed.
+
....
name contains "Gardening" or (code starts with "GAR" and startDateTime = tomorrow)
....

[[search-advanced-keywords]]
==== Keywords

In onCourse, a keyword is a reserved word that has a predefined meaning.

DATES::
  today;;
    the current day from 00:00 to 23:59
  yesterday;;
    yesterday from 00:00 to 23:59
  tomorrow;;
    tomorrow from 00:00 to 23:59
  last year;;
    from January 1 00:00 to December 31 23:59 of the previous year
  last month;;
    from the 1st of the previous month 00:00, to the last day of the
    previous month 23:59
  last week;;
    from Monday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59 of the previous week.
    If 'today' is Thursday 13 September 2018, then 'last week' will be
    from Monday 3 September 2018 to 9 September 2018.
  next year;;
    from January 1 00:00 to December 31 23:59 of the next year
  next month;;
    from the 1st of the next month 00:00 , to the last day of the next
    month 23:59
  next week;;
    from Monday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59 of the next week.
    If 'today' is Thursday 13 September 2018, then 'next week' will be
    from Monday 17 September 2018 to 24 September 2018.

....
createdOn today createdOn yesterday .. tomorrow startDateTime last week endDateTime next year
....
Dates can be combined with basic arithmetic and a specified time unit to query over a period of time.

....
createdOn today + 1 day createdOn yesterday..tomorrow + 2 week createdOn * .. today + 6 month createdOn 9:00 .. 19:00 today - 1 year
....


ME::
ME allows for search to be constructed using the currently logged in user as a query value.

....
Invoice.createdByUser = me
....

RELATIVE TIME::
Time references allow you to query for records within specific time periods
  now;;
    acts as a timestamp for the moment the query is run
  <x> hour;;
    set a number of hours to/from the search query period
  <x> minute;;
    set a number of minutes to/from the search query period
....
endDateTime in now + 1 hour .. now + 2 hours 30 minutes
....

EMPTY::

The Empty keyword allows you to search for null fields. A null field is a field that contains no data. For example if you were in the classes window and wanted to find all the classes with no tutor, you could type/select the below in the search query field:

....
tutorRoles is empty
....

[[search-advanced-arithmetic]]
==== Arithmetic

Basic arithmetic can be performed directly within the query language. Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and modulus operations are all supported.

....
feeHelpAmount is 100 + 50 feeHelpAmount is 100 - 50 feeHelpAmount is 100 / 2 feeHelpAmount is 100 * 5 feeHelpAmount is 100 % 3
....

==== Special attributes

Some record types have special attributes which aren't stored in the database, but calculated on the fly. Some examples are:

enrolmentCount::
Search Class records on the current count of active enrolments.
+
....
enrolmentCount = 3
....

isMinEnrolments::
Search Class records to find those that have reached their minimum or above.
+
....
isMinEnrolments = true
....

isMaxEnrolments::
Search Class records to find those that have reached their maximum capacity.
+
....
isMaxEnrolments = false
....


[[search-save]]
==== Saving custom searches

Any search query that you create in the advanced search bar can be saved for just yourself to use, or for everyone who uses your onCourse system.

The small bookmark icon shows you whether or not your search query is valid. When the search is empty it appears grey, when you're using an accepted query it'll display in green, and when using an invalid query it'll display in red. When the query is good and the bookmark is green, you can click the bookmark to save your search so it appears in the left-hand column. Just choose if you want it visible for only you or everyone who uses your system, give it a name then hit the save icon that appears next to it.

image::images/search/savesearch.png[These save options appear when you click the green bookmark icon that displays next to a valid query]


[[search-script]]
=== Searching in custom scripts

Scripts often need retrieve records from your database to perform some function. For example, if you wanted to contact all students who are enrolled in a class starting tomorrow, you would need to retrieve all classes that start tomorrow from the database.

Add a query panel to your script like this.

image::images/search/searchScript.png[]

The results of this query are then available to you in your script in the variable 'records'. You can use this to perform additional actions in the script.

Read more information on custom scripts here <<scripts, in our scripts chapter>>.
