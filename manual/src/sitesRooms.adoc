You can also add a description for the unavailability e.g; "construction on this site on 2/2/11".

[[sites-virtual]]
===== Virtual Sites

onCourse allows a College to flag a given Site as a Virtual Site. These sites can be used in either of the following scenarios:

* Classes that are delivered Online
* Self paced learning where there is no set timetable

When you create a new Site within onCourse and flag it as a Virtual Site, onCourse will automatically assign a Virtual Room to that site.
The reason for this is that Class enrolments must be assigned to a Room, they cannot be assigned to just a Site. Whilst this virtual room record is hidden within the user interface, it has been created automatically when the Site is flagged as being a Virtual Site.

You can also convert an existing Site to a Virtual Site by ticking this box within the General tab of the Site Record. Please note that if the existing Site which you wish to convert to a Virtual Site has more than 1 Room allocated against it, it cannot be converted to a Virtual Site.

===== Availability Rules

[[sitesRooms-Creating]]
=== Creating Sites and Rooms

The next step in setting up your onCourse program is entering sites and rooms. You can give each room a name, specific directions on how to get there, and describe the facilities that are available. It also allows you to make it possible for students to view detailed maps and instructions from your website about where their class will be held, saving your staff time with phone calls giving directions and saving students frustration when they can't accurately locate the venue.

Creating sites and rooms is a valuable part of your training resource management. Every time you book a session in a room, the Classes timetable is updated and the room becomes scheduled. This means that if you try to book another session in this room at the same time, you will be notified that it is already booked within the Class > Timetable tab. It's important to note that onCourse will not prevent you from double booking a room.

If you have a room or site that you hire on a casual basis you can also set the availability for it. For example, you may hire a public hall on Wednesday evenings. When you set up this room, you can specify it is only available for you to book between 5pm and 9pm. Course coordinators scheduling classes will an error message if they try to book a class in this room on another night, or to start before 5pm.

[TIP]
====
It is a good idea to enter the sites and rooms first so later when you add the courses you can easily assign them to a location.

==== How to set up a new site

. From the Sites list view, click on the + button. A new site screen will open on the details window in the general section.
. In the Name field enter the name of the site e.g. Waverley Campus. Remember the site is where the rooms are located and is not the rooms themselves, that comes later.
. Enter the street address of the site. If you report AVETMISS your sites must have accurate address suburbs and postcodes.
. Once you've entered the complete address, a Google Maps image denoting your sites location will appear.
. Move to the Directions section.
If you have specific driving directions, public transport directions or special instructions like parking, you can add them here. This information is published to your ish website. Because these description fields are Rich Text enabled (the blue A indicates this) you can add hyperlinks to local bus timetables or other useful pages for your students, like transport infoline or your local equivalent.
. If you have any internal notes about the site, you can add them on the notes tab. These are not published to your ish website.
. To set an unavailability for the site, go to the Availability Rules section and click on the + button.
. Create a new availability rule by clicking the +and define the Start and End date and time. You can also select 'all day' instead of selecting a time period.
. Choose if you wish to repeat the unavailability and the end date of the repeats. You also need to add a description of why the resource is unavailable.
. Click save. Once you have saved your site, click Close to be returned to the list view.
