[[tutors-Creating]]
=== Creating Tutors

You will need to keep your tutor's contact details on file and what classes and sessions they are scheduled to teach each term. If you are an RTO you will also need to keep copies of their resume and qualifications on file. onCourse allows you to do this using the Documents sections. Each tutor has their own personal file in onCourse which is easy to access and update.

If you have a large number of casual staff who work at a variety of different venues, it can be difficult to manage communication with them as you might not see them in person very often. Tutors listed in onCourse can be emailed or SMS'd easily and all messages sent out of the system are tracked in the tutors record helping you to keep all communications listed and organised.


. With the Contact window list view open, click on the + button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. A new contact screen will open.
. Set the contact as a Tutor. You will see that an additional section for tutor resume is added to the record.
. Enter the First Name and Last Name of the tutor.
. Enter the Address and other contact detail for the tutor. If you add an Email address, your tutors can log into your SkillsonCourse Portal to check their class schedules and you can email them directly from onCourse. If you enter a Mobile phone number, you can send SMS to your tutor from onCourse.
. For each contact method (mail, email and SMS) you have the option to opt the contact out of marketing communication. The default setting is to "accept marketing material," so when you click on the cog wheel above these fields, you will see this option is highlighted with a tick. This means that when you have marketing mail outs, this address will be on the mailing list. To change this setting simply click on the cog wheel and select the option "opt out from postal marketing material" if the person dosen't want to receive marketing communication from you. The other option is "undeliverable", meaning that no mail is to be delivered to this address because it is incorrect, or in the case of an email address, has received an undeliverable response from the mail server.
. The field message (alert for operator) is for any special notes that are important or relevant to this contact for eg. they might allow their phone number to be given to students.
. Use the resume section to create a publicly listed biography for the tutor. This screen shows that information which is displayed on your website. Be aware that this is an automatic function. For example, you might post a brief description for this particular tutor, their background and experience and how it relates to the courses they are teaching. As this information will be visible to students and general public on the website, it is recommended that you obtain permission from the tutor to publish this information. You can enter the text directly into the screen or cut and paste from another source. The text in the field can be formatted using Rich text.
. Move to the Notes section to add notes to the tutor record. The text in the notes field is private.
. To attach documents in the Documents section, click on the + sign next to Documents, then click Browse to find a file on your computer, or if the file is already in your onCourse, type the name you gave it when you first added it. Once you add the file it will appear here. You can also add a photo of the tutor by clicking the blank head in the top left corner of the page. This will open a browser window where you can select the image off your desktop.

[NOTE]
====
By creating a new tutor record and entering the email address for that tutor, the system will automatically create a new account for the Tutor to access the Skills onCourse Portal. You can then instruct your tutors to go to the Skills onCourse log in page and enter their first name, last name and email address and click on the Forgot Passwordlink. They will then receive an automatically generated email with their new password.
