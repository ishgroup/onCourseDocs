		<title>File structure</title>
		<para>Log into webDAV and look at this folder:<programlisting>/s/js/</programlisting></para>
		<para>In there you'll see a number of javascript files which drive your onCourse website.
			Some are third party vendor supplied files and others are default parts of onCourse
			itself. site.js is the starting point and it has a list of all the other files which are
			included. Note that the order of including files can sometimes be important. Let's look
			at site.js now:</para>
		<para>
			<programlisting>//= minify off
//= require base.js
//= require extra.js</programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>This is telling you that minification is disabled and that the javascript files base.js and
			extra.js are included. This is a different syntax to SCSS so don't get them confused.
			The combined output file is called all.js and the files which are merged don't need to
			start with an underscore.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Minification</title>
			<para>Unlike CSS, the javascript is not automatically minified. This is because sometimes
				javascript minification can actually break your javascript (particularly if it
				contains errors). Browsers will often manage to figure out your broken javascript,
				but once minified, errors really cause problems.</para>
			<para>You can enable minification by changing the "off" to "on" and saving the file. Wait about
				30 seconds and then review your site in staging before pushing it to live.</para>
			<para>We use the Google Closure compiler to verify and minify the output.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Compression</title>
			<para>all.js.gz is automatically created and used by browsers. This is another reason
				minification may not be quite so important: compression often does a pretty good job
				of reducing the file sizes.</para>

		<title>Core libraries</title>
		<para>We supply a number of third party javascript libraries with your site by default. The
			following list are bundled together as dynamic.js and cannot be removed without breaking
			some key shopping basket functionality on the site:</para>

					<para>classnames 2.2.5</para>

			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>There is also dynamic-polyfill.js to support IE 8. In addition there are some useful
			libraries which are often used when building sites: </para>
