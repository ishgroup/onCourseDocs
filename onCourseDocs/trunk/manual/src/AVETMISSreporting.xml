		<title>What is AVETMISS?</title>
		<para>AVETMISS stands for Australian Vocational Education and Training Management
			Information Statistical Standard.</para>
		<para>In the ASQA Standards for RTO's 2015 - Standard 7, clause 7.5 states "The RTO provides
			accurate and current information on its performance and governance consistent with the
			Data Provision Requirements as updated from time to time." Currently, this means
			mandatory RTO reporting is in line with the <link
				xlink:href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/F2013L00160Data">Data Provision
				Requirements 2012</link> via both the AVETMISS standard and Quality Indicator data
			for all vocational training learners (both funded and fee for service), unless it is
			exempt under the National VET Provider Collection Data Requirements Policy.</para>
		<para>If you are using onCourse, you're in luck - onCourse is the only free AVETMISS compliant
			student management database currently available to the Australian RTO market that
			exports both to the NCVER National standard and each state's AVETMISS variation for
			funded training. onCourse exports AVETMISS data compliant with the AVETMISS 7 and 8
			standards, including the USI requirements.</para>
		<para>The AVETMISS data you are required to submit are made up of a series of files with
			names like NAT00120. These files must be supplied as plain text in a fixed width format.
			These files are not very easy to create or read by a human as if one character is in the
			wrong place, the whole file can be rejected. The courses, classes, students and outcomes
			you create in onCourse will be exported out of onCourse into these files for you, ready
			to lodge as required.</para>

		<title>The AVETMISS Reporting Standard and File Specifications</title>
		<para>For a detailed explanation of the NCVER Standard AVETMISS 8 Export Standard, and how it relates to onCourse, refer to the <link
			xlink:href="AVETMISS8.html">AVETMISS 8 Chapter.</link>.</para>
		<para>Most states extend and modify the AVETMISS standard, and that information is included
			in this chapter.</para>
		<para>onCourse includes a variety of AVETMISS 'Flavours' to ensure you choose the right type
			of AVETMISS data depending on who you need to give your data to. The specifics about
			these flavours are explained below.</para>
		<para>onCourse flavours are usually related to Funding Contracts in onCourse. You should
			review the <link
				xlink:href="fundingContract.html">Funding Contracts chapter</link> to ensure you have enabled and set up the funding
			contracts and AVETMISS reporting flavours that are required in your training
			organisation.</para>
			<section>
				<title>NCVER (Standard AVETMISS)</title>
				<para>This export is to the AVETMISS VET Provider Collection Specifications National Length
				only, for each of the NAT file specifications. This is the option you should choose
				when reporting directly to NCVER. There are no state 'below the line fields'
				included in this export standard.</para>
			<para>If you require a standard AVETMISS export option with the state specific record
				length, we recommend using the Skills Tasmania export option. There are no special
				below the line rules in Tasmania.</para>
				<para>The standard export option stops at the National Record Collection point for
					each file and doesn't include any of the state specific fields.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>CSO (Community Colleges)</title>
				<para>AVETMISS CSO reporting is for Adult and Community Education customers who receive funding
				under the ACE Provider Contract to deliver the Adult and Community Education
				Community Service Obligation Program (ACE CSO Program) and/or the Tech Savvy Seniors
				(TSS) and Tech Saavy Small Business (TSB) program.</para>
				<para>Although this program is a subset of the NSW Smart &amp; Skilled program it is not
				reported via the usual STSOnline portal. ACE colleges are also expected to lodge the
				entirety of their training data for total VET Activity reporting, where it will be
				collated and sent to NCVER as a sector wide report. Non-VET training activity data
				can also be lodged and it is encouraged that ACE providers do so.</para>
				<para>State specific funded training (e.g. Smart &amp; Skilled) must also be reported via the
				State Training Service portal for that state. Reporting this data elsewhere does not
				exclude you from your reporting requirements for other contracts.</para>
				<para>Customers reporting CSO data are advised to choose this export option in the AVETMISS
				export process. This export option includes the standard below the line
				fields.</para>
				<para>Outcomes code Did Not Start - 66 will export a 66 code if reporting in CSO Flavour. </para>
				<para>Additional export overrides are in place to assist with the correct reporting
					of CSO and TSS data.</para>
				<itemizedlist>

			<para>In QLD, AVETMISS reporting is against your State RTO ID, rather than your
				National RTO ID. The National ID must be recorded in onCourse in the AVETMISS
				'Identifier' field for the USI validation process to work. Your QLD RTO ID
				should be entered in the AVETMISS preferences field 'Queensland RTO ID'. This
				value will export in the NAT00010, NAT00020 and NAT00130.</para>
			<para>onCourse will export the Unique Learner Identifier in the NAT00080 where it

			<para>In the NAT00120, onCourse will Only export Hours Attended data where the
				student outcome is marked as withdrawn</para>
			<para>In the NAT00120, onCourse will export the Full Time Learning option where this
				has been set in the student's enrolment.</para>
			<para>To report for the Certificate 3 Guarantee Program the following fields can be
				used:</para>
			<para>In the NAT00120, onCourse will export the state specific funding source code
				as it has been entered into the field 'Funding source state' on either the class
				VET tab (for all outcomes in that class), or into the outcome directly (for a
				single outcome).</para>
			<para>In the NAT00120, onCourse will export the fee exemption code C or N where it
				has been selected in the enrolment record from the QLD only options, for all
				outcomes linked to that enrolment.</para>
			<para>In the NAT00120, onCourse will export the outcome status 65 (Superseded

		<para>With the introduction of national VET reporting for all RTOs, there is no longer a

			reporting is still available in onCourse, however, in case you need to export data for
			previous years under this standard.</para>
		<para>The files required to submit via the CCOS are a little like a cut down version of
			AVETMISS, showing summary data of your training organisation's enrolment and completion
			rates.</para>
		<para>Some users are required to submit these directly, while other RTOs have this data
			extracted from their AVETMISS lodgement data automatically and do not need to submit any
			additional data.</para>
		<para>If you do need to submit this data each year, the three text files can be exported
			from onCourse to upload into the CCOS system as per the import data file format
			requirements outlined in the <link
				xlink:href="http://rto.ncver.edu.au/documents/Competency_Completion_Online_System_Guide.pdf"
				>Competency Completion Online System Guide PDF</link></para>

		<title>Special default Outcome Status and overrides</title>
		<para>You never need to set an outcomes of 70, 81 or 85 in onCourse. </para>
		<para>In the AVETMISS runner you will see information about outcome statuses that will be set by
			default during the export.</para>
		<para>Any VET outcome that is currently 'in progress' i.e. the end date is in the future,
			will be automatically exported with an outcome of 70, no matter the value set in the
			onCourse database. If the outcome status is unset, a 70 will be exported. If an outcome
			value like a 20 is set, a 70 will be exported. This is because the only valid value for
			an in progress outcome is 70.</para>
		<para>Any non-VET outcome with no status set will be exported as 81. You can manually set a
			non-vet outcome status within onCourse as 82 when it is needed, but there is no need to
			set 81, unless you have a business process that requires it.</para>
		<para>Any outcome that starts in the future will be exported with 85 - Not Yet Started. These
			outcomes are often only included in AVETMISS exports for funding purposes.</para>
		<para>If you have any outcomes where the end date is in the past, and a final outcome status
			has not yet been set, you can use the export runner to locate these outcomes and open
			the list in a new window, so you can set the value.</para>
		<para>Alternatively you can check the option in the export runner that says 'report these as
			continuing enrolment (70) ending 7 days from now' and the export runner will set the end
			date to the outcome to the future and set the value to 70. This saves you having to
			manually change end dates, when a student was predicted to, but didn't actually complete
			an outcome in the expected time frame.</para>
		<para>The information showed in the runner won't change the value stored in onCourse, only
			export the value you need in the AVETMISS files. The onCourse outcome status value will
			remain 'not set' or the other value already set in the database. A count of each of the
			special overrides is displayed in the AVETMISS runner so you can check the outcomes it
			applies to by clicking the open related record icon next to the count.</para>

			<title>Automatic Validation errors onCourse fixes for AVETMISS Reporting</title>

			<para><emphasis role="bold">Export to folder: </emphasis> Select a location where a
				folder containing the 10 AVETMISS text files will be created . The location MUST be
				on a local drive, you can not export to a folder on a network drive.</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Flavour: </emphasis>This AVETMISS variation type you want to
				export. Often these variations are based on State</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Select enrolments from: </emphasis>This directs the export
				runner to chose certain enrolments based on their Funding Source. If you haven't set
				any funding sources, all your courses will be Fee for service VET (non-funded) by
				default. For 'Fee for Service', you can further refine by delivery state. You can
				select multiple options here.</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Date range: </emphasis>The options available here are date
				based and will collect the OUTCOMES that fall into this date range: </para>
			<para><emphasis>commenced outcomes</emphasis> - all outcomes that have a start date in
				the past from the chosen enrolments. Be careful choosing this with 'Fee for service
				VET' or 'Non VET' as you will export every outcome ever created in your onCourse
				database. It is better chosen in combination with a specific Funding Source.</para>
			<para><emphasis>Previous calendar year</emphasis> - this will show in the drop down as a
				date range like '2017 year'</para>
			<para><emphasis>Previous calendar quarter</emphasis> - this will show in the drop down
				as a date range like '1 Jan 2018 - 30 April 2018'</para>
			<para><emphasis>Custom date range</emphasis> - this will display two text fields where you can
				enter your own start and end dates. </para>
			<para>NOTE: AVETMISS reporting is designed to report data in the past, so your date
				range end should be no later than today. </para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Checkbox - Include all outcomes linked by enrolment:</emphasis> When
				running a funded export, you often need to select this option as this collects the
				additional outcomes associated with the funded enrolment that may fall outside the
				outcome date range selected. For example. when reporting to Smart and Skilled, you
				must always report all outcomes associated with the funding, even if they haven't
				yet commenced, or completed in the past. This option is only available when you run
				the AVETMISS export from File > Import/Export. It doesn't display when running from
				the cogwheel, as all outcomes from enrolments are always included.</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Checkbox - xxx completed VET outcomes need a status. report these as
					continuing enrolment (70) ending 7 days from now:</emphasis> If the AVETMISS
				pre-run checks find outcomes that ended in the past where you haven't set a final
				status, you can automatically push the outcome end date forward by 7 days and report
				a 70. This does not change the outcome end date in onCourse, only for the data in
				the export file. The find related icon here also allows you to open the records in
				question and actually set a final outcome status if required. Note that if you have
				set an export end date in the future, this setting will not make much sense. e.g. If
				I have an outcome that was due to end next week, it would be reported today as an in
				progress 70. If I set an outcome end date of the end of the calender year, the
				outcome is considered to have been completed, but not properly finalised. Moral to
				the story - don't set an export end date after today's date unless you want some
				funky data issues.</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">xxx completed non-Vet outcomes have no status and will be reported as
					satisfactorily completed (81): </emphasis> If you have included non-VET outcomes
				in your export set, then an 81 will be reported for all unset outcomes. Where you
				have manually set another value like 82, that will be reported. The find related
				icon here also allows you to open the records in question and check where this
				override will be applied.</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">xxx outcomes will be exported: </emphasis>This is the total
				number of outcomes that the pre-run checks have found that meet your criteria. You
				should check this number matches the value you are expecting, and where needed, use
				the find related icon to view in a list the outcomes about to be exported.</para>

			government to get paid. Often, you will need to upload them to a website where they will
			be validated.</para>
		<para>NCVER provide a validation tool called AVS (AVETMISS Validation Software) that is often used
			to verify files before submission. You can find this tool at <link
				xlink:href="https://avs.ncver.edu.au/avs/">https://avs.ncver.edu.au/avs/</link>.
			This is also where you need to lodge your Fee For Service Training Activity each year or
			quarter. </para>
			<para>For some types of lodgement you will also need to supply the NAT00085 file. This is
			essentially the same as the NAT00080 but with your students personal addresses and other
			contact details. It will be automatically generated when you create an AVETMISS export.
			Be aware of the privacy implications of supplying this file to third parties. We suggest
			only supplying it when it is a requirement of your funding.</para>
			<para>Your local friendly funding body can help you from here on in if you encounter
				difficulties with their lodgement process. Customers with onCourse support plans can

		<title>Validating and correcting AVETMISS errors</title>
		<para>Prior to exporting your AVETMISS data, you may wish to run some reports inside

			organisational data for other reporting and segmenting of your VET delivery.</para>
		<para>From the classes window, two CSV exports are available. CSV files can be opened in
			Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet applications. If you ever wished you could easily
			open and read NAT00120 files in Excel, consider this the next best thing.</para>
		<para>Begin by opening the classes window and locating the classes you wish to export,
			through the usual sorts, searches and filters. Once you have located and highlighted the
			classes in the list view choose File > Import/Export > Export Classes</para>
		<para>From the export format list options, choose either 'class outcomes CSV report' or
			'extended outcomes CSV'.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Class Outcomes CSV</title>
			<para>The purpose of this export is to show you all the outcomes and the outcome status
				of the enrolments associated with the classes you've exported. This can be a useful
				way to locate outcomes where the end date has passed but a final result has not yet
				been entered into onCourse.</para>
			<para>This report contains the onCourse student number, student first and last name,
				course-class code, unit of competency code and name, outcome start and end date and
				outcome status.</para>
			<para>Keep in mind this report is showing you the actual data in the onCourse records -
				when you export actual AVETMISS data from onCourse, the export runner values will
				set outcome status 90 for outcomes in progress, and outcome status 70 for outcomes
				that end in future calendar years. The value inside the database will remain as not

			<title>How do I record a student's outcome who has completed a different elective from
				the rest of class?</title>
			<para>Once you have set up the outcomes at the Course level, every student enrolling in
				a Class from that Course will have all of the outcomes applied to their record. If a
				student chooses a different elective from the one you have set a the course level
				you can change their outcome so it is linked to a different Unit of
				Competency.</para>
			<para>You can do this by going into Class Outcome tab and double clicking on the outcome
				you wish to change. Type the Module code or Module name into the field and click OK
				to link to a new outcome.</para>
			<para>If you wish to add or delete an outcome from the student's record, you need to do
				this from the Enrolment Outcome tab. You will see a + and a - button in the top
				right hand corner. Use these to add or delete outcome records as required. </para>

			<title>How do I record information about a clients traineeship?</title>
			<para>When a student is completing a traineeship, you will have been given a 'Training
				Contract Identifier' and a Client 'Identifier' by your state funding body. They may
				call them by different names, but the important thing to confirm is that they are
				the data that exports into the NAT000120 in positions 70 &amp; 80
				respectively.</para>
			<para>This data is entered into the onCourse enrolment window. This data will need to be
				entered after enrolment by going to the Enrolment window, locating the student's
				enrolment record and double clicking on it. On the general tab you will find these
				fields.</para>
			<para>In NSW, you will need to put your Training Contract ID into BOTH of these fields,
				as NSW doesn't issue a separate Client Identifier for trainees.</para>
			<para>If you have broken the traineeship into multiple enrolments, each with one or more
				units of competency, you will need to enter this information into each enrolment
				record for the student that relates to the traineeship. This information is not
				recorded as part of the student's master contact record, as the student may also
				have other enrolment records which don't form part of this traineeship.</para>

			<title>Why do some outcomes in the NAT000120 export with start and end dates of
				00000000?</title>
			<para>This is a date that has not been defined, e.g. instead of exporting an eight digit
				date like 01012012, it has exported no date, or a string of zeros as
				placeholders.</para>
			<para>What this means is that the class the outcome belongs to has no sessions defined.
				With no sessions, there are no start or end dates available. Also, if you have a
				self paced class where you have not defined the duration, the start date will be the
				date of enrolment as usual, but the end date will default to 12 months after the
				start date.</para>
			<para>Look for any unscheduled or self paced classes in your onCourse records, and add
				either some session information or manual start and end dates to each outcome in the
				class.</para>

			<title>Why, in the AVETMISS export, do my non-VET courses have codes like ISH123?</title>
			<para>In onCourse version 5.0 we increased the Course Code field length to 32
				characters, to give onCourse Web users more SEO choices for the URL that was created
				for their course page.</para>
			<para>The AVETMISS standard NAT00060 allows for up to 12 characters in the 'subject identifier
				text'. We also have some users who have to report to other government bodies which
				further restrict them to using 8 or 10 of these available characters only as they
				append their own codes to this field.</para>
			<para>While we require course codes in onCourse to be unique, if we only exported the
				first 8 characters of user defined course code, we could very easily end up
				exporting two courses with duplicate codes that then causes an AVETMISS validation
				error. Take, for example course codes ComputerClassSeniors and ComputerClassOpen,
				both which are valid in onCourse and create good URLs like
				www.mycollegename.com.au/course/ComputerClassSeniors and
				www.mycollegename.com.au/course/ComputerClassOpen. </para>
			<para>Exporting the first 8, 10 or 12 characters for these courses would give us the
				identical code 'Computer', 'ComputerCl' or 'ComputerClas', all of which would be
				duplicates. Instead of this possible duplication, we export a made up code that will
				look something like ISH123 and will not ever create duplicate records in the export. </para>
			<para>Keep in mind, that for courses that aren't linked to training packages, the code
				reported in AVETMISS here has no meaning at all - it just has to be a unique
				identifier within your organisation. These 'made up' codes only affect your non-VET
				courses - real VET enrolments are always referenced to the unit(s) of competency
				they student enrolled in</para>
			<para>This does mean if you need to follow up another sort of validation error
				referencing an enrolment in ISH123 you'll need to check your NAT00060 export file to
				see that ISH123, for example is the export code for the course with the name
				'Introduction to Computers for Seniors'.</para>
			<para>As always, we walk the line in meeting the best business, sales and marketing
				functions for your college AND meeting the AVETMISS requirements in the most
				non-onerous way we can. Where these two needs conflict, we will try and code our way
				around it in the export process so we that don't stop you doing what you want in the
				onCourse software.</para>

			<title>How does prior learning affect AVETMISS reports?</title>
			<para>Prior learning records only export from AVETMISS exports run from the file >
				import/export >export AVETMISS menu option. They will not export from the cogwheel
				option in the classes or enrolments window, because they are not associated with
				either a class or an enrolment, but instead are attached directly to the
				student.</para>
			<para>When you create a prior learning record with one or more outcomes attached, and the start
				and end dates of the prior learning outcomes fall into the 'outcomes after' to
				-'outcomes before' date range set in the AVETMISS export runner, then the data
				associated with the prior learning record will export.</para>
			<para>At a minimum, to create successful AVETMISS files your prior learning outcomes
				need, in addition to a start date and end date, an outcome status. All other values
				are optional.</para>
			<para>If a Delivery Mode is not set, 'classroom based' will export as the default,
				unless the outcome has an RPL status, in which case the delivery mode ' not
				applicable' will export.</para>
			<para>If the Funding Source - national is not set, then the default funding source set
				in the college preferences will be applied.</para>
			<para>If the prior learning record was linked to a qualification or skills set, then the
				Commencing Program Identifier will export as '3 - commencing enrolment', otherwise
				it will export as '8 - module only enrolment'. </para>
			<para>If the prior learning record was linked to a qualification or skills set, then the
				Study Reason Identifier will export as '11 - other reasons'.</para>
			<para>The VET in Schools flag will always export as No.</para>
			<para>The training location for all prior learning outcomes will be set to your college
				default administration site address.</para>
