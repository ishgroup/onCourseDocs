		<title>Explaining the AVETMISS runner choices</title>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Flavour: </emphasis>This AVETMISS variation type you want to
			export. Often these variations are based on State</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Select enrolments from: </emphasis>This directs the export
			runner to chose certain enrolments based on their Funding Source. If you haven't set any
			funding sources, all your courses will be Fee for service VET (non-funded) by default.
			For 'Fee for Service', you can further refine by delivery state. You can select multiple
			options here.</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Date range: </emphasis>The options available here are date based
			and will collect the OUTCOMES that fall into this date range: </para>
		<para><emphasis>commenced outcomes</emphasis> - all outcomes that have a start date in the
			past from the chosen enrolments. Be careful choosing this with 'Fee for service VET' or
			'Non VET' as you will export every outcome ever created in your onCourse database. It is
			better chosen in combination with a specific Funding Source.</para>
		<para><emphasis>Previous calendar year</emphasis> - this will show in the drop down as a
			date range like '2017 year'</para>
		<para><emphasis>Previous calendar quarter</emphasis> - this will show in the drop down as a
			date range like '1 Jan 2018 - 30 April 2018'</para>
		<para><emphasis>Custom date range</emphasis> - this will display two text fields where you
			can enter your own start and end dates. </para>
		<para>NOTE: AVETMISS reporting is designed to report data in the past, so your date range
			end should be no later than today. </para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Checkbox - Include all outcomes linked by enrolment:</emphasis>
			When running a funded export, you often need to select this option as this collects the
			additional outcomes associated with the funded enrolment that may fall outside the
			outcome date range selected. For example. when reporting to Smart and Skilled, you must
			always report all outcomes associated with the funding, even if they haven't yet
			commenced, or completed in the past. This option is only available when you run the
			AVETMISS export from File > Import/Export. It doesn't display when running from the
			cogwheel, as all outcomes from enrolments are always included.</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">History</emphasis> - This section shows you a list of the most recent
			AVETMISS exports to be run on your system, allowing you to run them again or review the
			outcomes exported by each. You can also set a status for each–either Success, Fail or
			Exported–so you can tell in the future which extracts were reported successfully. You
			must set this manually; the next time you open the AVETMISS export window after running
			an extract you'll be asked a question about your previous export, whether it was
			successful, failed or outcome unknown. Once you choose an answer the export will be
			'filed' in the History section as the most recent export, and display the time of the
			export, the number of outcomes, the user who ran it and the success/failure flag.</para>
		<para>These records will last in the system dependant on how they're flagged. Exports
			flagged as Success will remain forever, while those set as Exported will remain for 28
			days. Any set as failed will only be stored for three days.</para>

		</mediaobject>
		<para>Other options will appear once you have made your initial query (after hitting the
			'find' button), these are outlined below:</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold"># of Outcomes &amp; Enrolments</emphasis> The exact number of
			outcomes, and their attached enrolments, will appear at the top of the new window. Check
			this number matches the value you are expecting.</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Status Breakdowns</emphasis> Each outcome status has an
			individual breakdown showing the number of outcomes to be exported with this status.
			Click the 'open related' icon to the right of the number count to see a full list of
			each outcome with this status.</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Delivery - xxx pending status. Export as continuing (70) ending
				7 days from now:</emphasis> If the AVETMISS pre-run checks find outcomes that ended
			in the past where you haven't set a final status, you can automatically push the outcome
			end date forward by 7 days and report a 70. This does not change the outcome end date in
			onCourse, only for the data in the export file. The find related icon here also allows
			you to open the records in question and actually set a final outcome status if required.
			Note that if you have set an export end date in the future, this setting will not make
			much sense. e.g. If I have an outcome that was due to end next week, it would be
			reported today as an in progress 70. If I set an outcome end date of the end of the
			calender year, the outcome is considered to have been completed, but not properly
			finalised. Moral to the story - don't set an export end date after today's date unless
			you want some funky data issues.</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold"> Final Status</emphasis> This is a breakdown of the number of
			different outcomes included in the final export data. This window, in fact the whole
			screen, is a useful tool to review the data before exported before you create the file,
			so you can visually see any possible issues before you submit to AVS. If you do spot
			anything out of the ordinary, you can click the 'open related' icon to the right of each
			record to see an overview of each outcome included with that status.</para>

		<title>How to give your AVETMISS data to the people who want to pay you</title>
		<para>Either of the methods above will have created a folder on your computer with text
			files, all with file names like NAT00080 and NAT00130. These are things you need to give
			to the government to get paid. Often, you will need to upload them to a website where
			they will be validated.</para>
		<para>NCVER provide a validation tool called AVS (AVETMISS Validation Software) that is
			often used to verify files before submission. You can find this tool at <link
				xlink:href="https://avs.ncver.edu.au/avs/">https://avs.ncver.edu.au/avs/</link>.
			This is also where you need to lodge your Fee For Service Training Activity each year or
			quarter. </para>
		<para>For some types of lodgement you will also need to supply the NAT00085 file. This is
			essentially the same as the NAT00080 but with your students personal addresses and other
			contact details. It will be automatically generated when you create an AVETMISS export.
			Be aware of the privacy implications of supplying this file to third parties. We suggest
			only supplying it when it is a requirement of your funding.</para>
		<para>Your local friendly funding body can help you from here on in if you encounter
			difficulties with their lodgement process. Customers with onCourse support plans can
			also log a task in squish for additional assistance.</para>

		<title>Validating and correcting AVETMISS errors</title>
		<para>Prior to exporting your AVETMISS data, you may wish to run some reports inside
			onCourse to check the values you have set. These reports can also be useful
			organisational data for other reporting and segmenting of your VET delivery.</para>
		<para>From the classes window, two CSV exports are available. CSV files can be opened in
			Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet applications. If you ever wished you could easily
			open and read NAT00120 files in Excel, consider this the next best thing.</para>
		<para>Begin by opening the classes window and locating the classes you wish to export,
			through the usual sorts, searches and filters. Once you have located and highlighted the
			classes in the list view choose File > Import/Export > Export Classes</para>
		<para>From the export format list options, choose either 'class outcomes CSV report' or
			'extended outcomes CSV'.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Class Outcomes CSV</title>
			<para>The purpose of this export is to show you all the outcomes and the outcome status
				of the enrolments associated with the classes you've exported. This can be a useful
				way to locate outcomes where the end date has passed but a final result has not yet
				been entered into onCourse.</para>
			<para>This report contains the onCourse student number, student first and last name,
				course-class code, unit of competency code and name, outcome start and end date and
				outcome status.</para>
			<para>Keep in mind this report is showing you the actual data in the onCourse records -
				when you export actual AVETMISS data from onCourse, the export runner values will
				set outcome status 90 for outcomes in progress, and outcome status 70 for outcomes
				that end in future calendar years. The value inside the database will remain as not
				set.</para>

				most) of the students in the class have the same funding source applying to
				them.</para>
			<para>First you will need to make sure you have an up to date list of the appropriate
				State Funding Codes to use within your reporting state. onCourse doesn't maintain a

			</mediaobject>
			<para>If a student has a different funding code which applies to them, you can just
				change their enrolment funding codes to make it different to the one set at the
				class level. If all students in the class have different funding codes, you don't
				need to set anything at the class level, but can set each outcome separately on the
				enrolment general tab. </para>
			<para>Where the value populates from a record level above, you will see the value in the
				lower level record with the lock icon. In this case, it means the enrolment is
				inheriting the value from the level above, the class. You can click the unlock icon

			<title>How do I record a student's outcome who has completed a different elective from
				the rest of class?</title>
			<para>Once you have set up the outcomes at the Course level, every student enrolling in
				a Class from that Course will have all of the outcomes applied to their record. If a
				student chooses a different elective from the one you have set a the course level
				you can change their outcome so it is linked to a different Unit of
				Competency.</para>
			<para>You can do this by going into Class Outcome tab and double clicking on the outcome
				you wish to change. Type the Module code or Module name into the field and click OK
				to link to a new outcome.</para>
			<para>If you wish to add or delete an outcome from the student's record, you need to do
				this from the Enrolment Outcome tab. You will see a + and a - button in the top
				right hand corner. Use these to add or delete outcome records as required. </para>

			<title>How do I record information about a clients traineeship?</title>
			<para>When a student is completing a traineeship, you will have been given a 'Training
				Contract Identifier' and a Client 'Identifier' by your state funding body. They may
				call them by different names, but the important thing to confirm is that they are
				the data that exports into the NAT000120 in positions 70 &amp; 80
				respectively.</para>
			<para>This data is entered into the onCourse enrolment window. This data will need to be
				entered after enrolment by going to the Enrolment window, locating the student's
				enrolment record and double clicking on it. On the general tab you will find these
				fields.</para>
			<para>In NSW, you will need to put your Training Contract ID into BOTH of these fields,
				as NSW doesn't issue a separate Client Identifier for trainees.</para>
			<para>If you have broken the traineeship into multiple enrolments, each with one or more
				units of competency, you will need to enter this information into each enrolment
				record for the student that relates to the traineeship. This information is not
				recorded as part of the student's master contact record, as the student may also
				have other enrolment records which don't form part of this traineeship.</para>

			<title>Why do some outcomes in the NAT000120 export with start and end dates of
				00000000?</title>
			<para>This is a date that has not been defined, e.g. instead of exporting an eight digit
				date like 01012012, it has exported no date, or a string of zeros as
				placeholders.</para>
			<para>What this means is that the class the outcome belongs to has no sessions defined.
				With no sessions, there are no start or end dates available. Also, if you have a
				self paced class where you have not defined the duration, the start date will be the
				date of enrolment as usual, but the end date will default to 12 months after the
				start date.</para>
			<para>Look for any unscheduled or self paced classes in your onCourse records, and add
				either some session information or manual start and end dates to each outcome in the
				class.</para>

			<title>Why, in the AVETMISS export, do my non-VET courses have codes like
				ISH123?</title>
			<para>In onCourse version 5.0 we increased the Course Code field length to 32
				characters, to give onCourse Web users more SEO choices for the URL that was created
				for their course page.</para>
			<para>The AVETMISS standard NAT00060 allows for up to 12 characters in the 'subject
				identifier text'. We also have some users who have to report to other government
				bodies which further restrict them to using 8 or 10 of these available characters
				only as they append their own codes to this field.</para>
			<para>While we require course codes in onCourse to be unique, if we only exported the
				first 8 characters of user defined course code, we could very easily end up
				exporting two courses with duplicate codes that then causes an AVETMISS validation
				error. Take, for example course codes ComputerClassSeniors and ComputerClassOpen,
				both which are valid in onCourse and create good URLs like
				www.mycollegename.com.au/course/ComputerClassSeniors and
				www.mycollegename.com.au/course/ComputerClassOpen. </para>
			<para>Exporting the first 8, 10 or 12 characters for these courses would give us the
				identical code 'Computer', 'ComputerCl' or 'ComputerClas', all of which would be
				duplicates. Instead of this possible duplication, we export a made up code that will
				look something like ISH123 and will not ever create duplicate records in the export. </para>
			<para>Keep in mind, that for courses that aren't linked to training packages, the code
				reported in AVETMISS here has no meaning at all - it just has to be a unique
				identifier within your organisation. These 'made up' codes only affect your non-VET
				courses - real VET enrolments are always referenced to the unit(s) of competency
				they student enrolled in</para>
			<para>This does mean if you need to follow up another sort of validation error
				referencing an enrolment in ISH123 you'll need to check your NAT00060 export file to
				see that ISH123, for example is the export code for the course with the name
				'Introduction to Computers for Seniors'.</para>
			<para>As always, we walk the line in meeting the best business, sales and marketing
				functions for your college AND meeting the AVETMISS requirements in the most
				non-onerous way we can. Where these two needs conflict, we will try and code our way
				around it in the export process so we that don't stop you doing what you want in the
				onCourse software.</para>

			<title>How does prior learning affect AVETMISS reports?</title>
			<para>Prior learning records only export from AVETMISS exports run directly from the Export
				AVETMISS 8 window. They will not export from the cogwheel option in the classes or
				enrolments window, because they are not associated with either a class or an
				enrolment, but instead are attached directly to the student.</para>
			<para>When you create a prior learning record with one or more outcomes attached, and
				the start and end dates of the prior learning outcomes fall into the 'outcomes
				after' to -'outcomes before' date range set in the AVETMISS export runner, then the
				data associated with the prior learning record will export.</para>
			<para>At a minimum, to create successful AVETMISS files your prior learning outcomes
				need, in addition to a start date and end date, an outcome status. All other values
				are optional.</para>
			<para>If a Delivery Mode is not set, 'classroom based' will export as the default,
				unless the outcome has an RPL status, in which case the delivery mode ' not
				applicable' will export.</para>
			<para>If the Funding Source - national is not set, then the default funding source set
				in the college preferences will be applied.</para>
			<para>If the prior learning record was linked to a qualification or skills set, then the
				Commencing Program Identifier will export as '3 - commencing enrolment', otherwise
				it will export as '8 - module only enrolment'. </para>
			<para>If the prior learning record was linked to a qualification or skills set, then the
				Study Reason Identifier will export as '11 - other reasons'.</para>
			<para>The VET in Schools flag will always export as No.</para>
			<para>The training location for all prior learning outcomes will be set to your college
				default administration site address.</para>

			<title>How can I add the outcome 85 to my AVETMISS data?</title>
			<para>This outcome is not available in the drop down list to set in onCourse because it
				is a transactional outcome status, not a final status. Transitional statuses are
				outcomes that change over the duration of the student's study and just have meaning
				related to the outcome start and end date, like 'in progress' or 'not yet
				commenced'. 85 means 'Not Yet Started' therefore, the outcome start date is after
				the day you run the export. If your start and end dates are set to represent the
				student's intended traning plan, 85 will export automatically where it is the only
				correct value. The same process applies to '70 - Continuing Activity', where the
				outcomes start date is before today and end date is after today.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>I set an outcome status in onCourse, but something different came out in the
				AVETMISS export. Why?</title>
			<para>onCourse includes advanced error correction in the AVETMISS export process to
				reduce the error rate during the reporting process. For example, if you have an
				outcome end date after the export end date (or today, if you have entered no export
				end date), then the only valid outcome is '70 - Continuing Activity' because the
				outcome is still in progress. If you have set a final outcome, like '20 - Competency
				Achieved' but the end date is in the future, then 70 will be exported because it is
				the only valid status for the date range.</para>
			<para>Note that if your tutors use the SkillsOnCourse portal to set outcomes, it will
				automatically set the outcome end date to the day a final status is set, reducing
				the instance of this issue.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Why can I add the outcome 70 to my AVETMISS data if it applies automatically when
				it's required? </title>
			<para>For the management purposes of enrolments with complex and changing training
				plans, some organisations like to manually set 70 to indicate a student has actually
				commenced their scheduled training, and leave the outcomes that are yet to commence
				as 'not set'. This can be a second process check along with ensuring the training
				plan dates in onCourse are accurate.</para>
			<para>There is no need to ever set 70 in onCourse for accurate AVETMISS reporting, but
				you can set 70 for other, intenal data management, reasons.</para>
