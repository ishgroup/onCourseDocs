		<title>What is AVETMISS?</title>
		<para>AVETMISS stands for Australian Vocational Education and Training Management
			Information Statistical Standard.</para>
		<para>In the ASQA Standards for RTO's 2015 - Standard 7, clause 7.5 states "The RTO provides
			accurate and current information on its performance and governance consistent with the
			Data Provision Requirements as updated from time to time." Currently, this means
			mandatory RTO reporting is in line with the <link
				xlink:href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/F2013L00160Data">Data Provision
				Requirements 2012</link> via both the AVETMISS standard and Quality Indicator data
			for all vocational training learners (both funded and fee for service), unless it is
			exempt under the National VET Provider Collection Data Requirements Policy.</para>
		<para>If you are using onCourse, you're in luck - onCourse is the <link
				xlink:href="http://www.ish.com.au/node/1538">only free AVETMISS compliant</link>
			student management database currently available to the Australian RTO market that
			exports both to the NCVER National standard and each state's AVETMISS variation for
			funded training. onCourse exports AVETMISS data compliant with the AVETMISS 7 and 8
			standards, including the USI requirements.</para>
		<para>The AVETMISS data you are required to submit are made up of a series of files with
			names like NAT00120. These files must be supplied as plain text in a fixed width format.
			These files are not very easy to create or read by a human as if one character is in the
			wrong place, the whole file can be rejected. The courses, classes, students and outcomes
			you create in onCourse will be exported out of onCourse into these files for you, ready
			to lodge as required.</para>

			<title>Training Organisation (NAT00010) file</title>
			<para>All the data in this file is collected in the onCourse general preferences window. Go to
				File > Preferences > General. Select the AVETMISS tab and enter the contact details
				of your business. It is important your RTO Identifier and name match the details
				recorded on training.gov.au</para>
		</section>

			<title>Training Organisation Delivery Location (NAT00020) File</title>
			<para>These are your onCourse sites. Set up each site where you deliver training and
				enter the address details. You can ignore the latitude and longitude fields.
				onCourse will require you to create at least one room for each site (this has
				nothing to do with AVETMISS, it is part of our timetabling feature) so to make it
				simple, give each site a room with a generic name like 'default'.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Program (NAT00030) File Subject (NAT00060) File</title>
			<para>This information comes from the onCourse Course detail. When you create a new
				course in onCourse, go to the VET tab and add the Qualification and Unit(s) that you
				are delivering as part of this program. All the TGA (training.gov.au) data is built
				in so when you start typing the code, the rest of the unit information will appear
				to select from the list. You can set up full qualification courses here or short
				courses with one or more units. </para>
			<para>As you add the units, add the nominal hours information to each unit. </para>
			<note>
				<para>Currently TGA doesn't record or publish the module details of state accredited
					courses. If you would like us to add the accredited course modules you deliver
					to onCourse, please contact us and we will import them for you at no additional
					charge. This service is available for customers on any of our commercial support

			<title>Client (NAT00080) File and Client Postal Details (NAT00085) File and Disability
				(NAT00090) File and Prior Educational Achievement (NAT00100) File </title>
			<para>Client files in onCourse are called contacts. Create each of your students as
				contacts in onCourse, ensuring you fill in their address details and the data on the
				AVETMISS tab. Unique client identifiers are auto assigned. You don't see these in
				the contact detail, but you can search on them from the contact window if you later
				get a validation error for one of your clients.</para>
			<para>To meet the AVETMISS export, onCourse automatically splits addresses into the required
				building name, unit name, street number and street name fields for export. In the
				user interface, the address field remains the same - enrolling students and
				administrative staff only need to enter the data in a single field.</para>
			<para>The Unique Student Identifier (USI) is reported in the NAT00080 file for each
				student engaged in Vocational Education and Training. Students who have only
				attended non-vocational courses do not need to have a USI supplied for AVETMISS
				reporting. </para>
			<para>You are required to validate each student's USI against their first name, last
				name and date of birth with the USI Registry System. If you have an onCourse support
				plan and have supplied us with your AusKey, onCourse will do this automatically for
				each USI supplied.</para>

			<title>Enrolment (NAT00120) File</title>
			<para>This is the biggest and most critical file - all the detail about what students
				have enrolled in and completed and whether or not your going to get payment for it.
				This information comes from a variety of locations in onCourse, so field by field
				we'll cover it here:</para>
			<section>
				<title>Training Organisation Delivery Location Identifier</title>
				<para>This is a numerical reference back to the site you have set up. You can cross
					reference this with the sites reported in the NAT00020 file. If your onCourse
					classes are not linked to a site, or linked to a virtual site, your default
					admin site details will be reported.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Client Identifier</title>
				<para>This is the onCourse student number that was automatically assigned when the
					student record was first created. This number can change over time when you
					merge students. You can cross reference the students in the NAT00080 and
					NAT00085 files. </para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Subject Identifier</title>
				<para>For VET courses, this is the National Code of the associated unit of
					competency. For non-VET courses this is a unique ISH reference number. You can
					see a student's unit and additional outcome data in their student record or in
					their enrolment records. This information is cross referenced with the NAT00060
					file.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Program Identifier</title>
				<para>This is the National Code of the courses related Qualification. This field is
					only populated if you marked the course as a 'is sufficient for a full
					qualification' in onCourse, unless you are exporting in QLD or NSW where it will
					always be exported if you have linked the course to a Qualification. This
					information is cross referenced with the NAT00030 file.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Enrolment Activity Start Date and Enrolment Activity End Date</title>
				<para>This is set in the class you have enrolled the student in. When you set up a
					class in onCourse, create a class schedule with at least two sessions
					representing the start and end date on the timetable tab. If you need to modify
					the start or end date for an individual student, you can do it through their
					contact record or through the class window by looking on the Outcome tab and
					changing the date in the field for the student/unit combination of your choice.
					If you change the class start and end dates, it will update the outcome start
					and end dates for all students enrolled in the class, except those where you
					have already manually edited the date.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Delivery Mode Identifier</title>
				<para>Your preferred default setting can be set on the general preferences Class Defaults tab.
					This can be changed for each Class on the VET tab. You can also make changes for
					individual students on the Outcome list or through their individual enrolment.
					Because onCourse supports both AVETMISS 7 and 8, some delivery modes will be
					translated when you export to the older AVETMISS 7 standard. </para>
				<para>Classroom and online will be exported as 10, Classroom and workplace as 30,
					Online and workplace as 30, and Classroom, online &amp; workplace as 30.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Outcome Identifier - National</title>
				<para>You can set the outcome identifier (we call it status) on the Outcomes tab in
					the Class window. If you select all the records in the list and right click on
					them, you can set them all to 'Successful (20)' and then go back and change the
					others that should be other statuses (like RPL or Not Yet Competent) one by one.
					Or you can set them all one by one, whichever you prefer. You can also set the
					outcome status in the student contact record or the enrolment record.</para>
				<para>If you set an outcome an RPL, RCC or Credit Transfer status, the Delivery Mode
					Identifier will always export as 90 - NA regardless of what is set in the
					outcome value.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Scheduled Hours</title>
				<para>The scheduled hours reported are the nominal hours that you set in the unit of
					competency. If you added the nominal hours when setting up the course it will
					report here. You can override the Scheduled Hours in the individual
					outcome.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Funding Source - National</title>
				<para>You preferred default setting can be set on the general preferences Class

				<title>Commencing Program Identifier</title>
				<para>If the student was enrolled in a class linked to a course marked as a full

				<title>Client Tuition Fee</title>
				<para>This is the fee you charged the student at the time of enrolment, divided by

					class fee in the Class General tab. VET courses are usually GST exempt. During
					the enrolment process, you can charge the student the full fee or give them a
					manual discount if they meet fee exemption criteria. The fee they pay here is
					what is reported. If you don't usually use onCourse for invoicing and payment
					records, create a full cash payment for each student on enrolment. Don't worry
					about the invoices that are automatically created here - they have nothing to do
					with AVETMISS.</para>

			<title>Program Completed (NAT000130) File</title>
			<para>To record student completion of a qualification or skill set in onCourse, you must
				create a qualification or skill set certificate for them.</para>
			<para>onCourse will create AQF compliant certificates for your students, but for the
				purposes of lodging AVETMISS, you don't need to print or issue them. </para>
			<para>To create a Certificate record, open the certificate window and click plus. Type
				the name of the student and the code of the qualification or skill set you wish to
				issue and choose the outcomes from the student's record you wish to add to the
				certificate. Check the option 'qualification or skill set' and save the
				record.</para>
			<para>Alternatively, you can do this automatically from the class list or enrolment list
				records by highlighting the records you want to create certificates for and
				selecting the cogwheel 'create certificates' function. If the enrolment or class is
				linked to a course where 'satisfies complete qualification or skill set' is ticked,
				then a Qualification or skill set certificate will be created, otherwise it will
				default to a Statement of Attainment. Only Qualification and skill set completions
				are reported in the NAT00130 file.</para>
			<para>The 'awarded on' date determines the date of certificate issue for AVETMISS reporting
				purposes. By default, this date will be the date the certificate was created in
				onCourse. If you create certificates early in a calendar year that need to be
				reported as part of the previous calendar years completions, be sure to back date
				the 'awarded on' date to the previous year.</para>
			<para>If you are exporting a NSW DET export, and have set all the outcomes for an
				enrolment (e.g. they are no longer blank) a NAT000130 file will be automatically
				created for you, even if you have not delivered a full qualification to the student.
				This is because NSW DET uses the NAT00130 file for a different purpose than the
				national standard. </para>
			<para>If you are exporting to Victoria, the student intent to complete a certificate will be
				recorded here also. This record is created when a student is enrolled into a class
				linked to a course where 'satisfies complete qualification or skill set' is ticked.
				Until you create the Certificate record on their successful completion, the record
				will contain an 'N' for not issued.</para>

					AVETMISS export option with the state specific record length, we recommend using

				<title>NSW Smart and Skilled (for 2015 onwards data)</title>
				<para>This export option is for reporting Smart &amp; Skilled funded training in NSW
					and meets the requirements of the <link

						>Smart and Skilled eReporting Technical Specifications and Business
						Validations Version 1.3 November 2015 specifications.</link></para>
				<para>The 'Outcome identifier - Training Organisation' field has been added to the
					Enrolment general tab to record the possible Training not completed (TNC) or
					Training Deferred (D) value for the enrolment.</para> 
				<para>After changing the Enrolment to TNC, you  will need to go to the outcomes change them all

				<para>Once you have reported this enrolment, and had it accepted by State Training Services, you

					AVETMISS'.</para>
				<para>The field Purchasing Contract Identifier, which previously existed at the
					class level has also been added to the enrolment general tab, with the NSW
					specific label of Commitment ID. All outcomes in an enrolment will be reported
					with the same Commitment ID.</para>
				<para>The field Funding Source - State Training Authority field which was previously

				<para>At the point in time the Smart &amp; Skilled export is run, any outcomes
					selected with a start date in the future will export with a two blank spaces in
					the place of the outcome identifier - national, regardless of what has been set
					in the database or in the export runner preferences. i.e. you can choose the
					option 'export 90 - not yet available for VET outcomes which are not set' and
					the Smart &amp; Skilled override for the two blank spaces will still apply where
					appropriate.</para>
				<para>An email address for all Smart &amp; Skilled students is mandatory. If the
					student does not have an email address, or has chosen not to provide one,
					onCourse will export notprovided@example.com.</para>

				<title>NSW DET - APL (for 2014 data or earlier)</title>
				<para>This export option is for reporting to the NSW Training Market and meets the
					requirements of the ePayments Factsheet 4.3 - March 2014 Data Specifications.
					This means you will export blank spaces for the outcome where the outcome has
					not been set for this option.</para>
				<para>NSW has three special NSW only 'below the line' fields that are used in
					reporting. They are the Booking ID (NAT00120 position 143), Course Site ID
					(NAT00120 position 153) and Training Plan developed (NAT00120 position 163). The
					first two fields can be found in the class VET tab, with the Training Plan
					developed field located on the enrolment general tab.</para>
				<para>When reporting, the way your data is set up will determine if the export will
					trigger an initial, midway or final payment.</para>
				<para>An initial payment will be triggered the first time you lodge the data for a
					new student and course combination. Usually you would report some or all of the
					units of competency that the student will be completing during the course, but
					with no outcome status.</para>
				<para>NSW also likes to see that the start and end dates of the various units in the
					course are not all the same i.e. they do not all start and end on the same day.
					We recommend you use the training plan feature in the class timetable to vary
					the start and end dates across the course duration.</para>
				<para>A midway payment is determined when you show progress in the course. This
					could be because you have enrolled the student in additional units of
					competency, or because the student has achieved an outcome for some of the units
					of competency you reported in the initial lodgement.</para>
				<para>If you try to report after the initial, a changed status where all the units
					have an outcome, this will trigger the midway and final payment in one
					action.</para>
				<para>Keep in mind that you will always get an error if you try to report a
					student's final outcome status prior to the outcome end date. If you do have a
					final status you wish to report, then change the outcome end date to a date
					prior the day you want to lodge the data.</para>
				<para>The special difference between a midway and final payment is the generation of
					the NAT00130 (course completion) record. onCourse generates this automatically,
					you don't need to set anything in the student's record.</para>
				<para>The NAT00130 record file is created to indicate the student's enrolment is
					completed. There is a record created for this file either because all their
					outcomes from the class are set and all the outcome end dates are before the end
					date of the export specified. If all of the outcomes have a successful status
					(e.g. competent, RPL granted, credit transfer ect) and the enrolment was in a
					class linked to a course marked as 'satisfies requirement for a complete
					qualification' then the NAT00130 will have a Y, for a successful course
					completion. If any of the outcomes have an unsuccessful status (e.g. withdrawn,
					not yet competent, did not start) for a full qualification enrolment, or the
					enrolment was in a short course then the NAT00130 will output a N for
					non-qualification completion.</para>
				<para>If you are doing a final export you must ensure you choose an end date before
					the day of export but after the last end date of the outcomes when exporting -
					initial and midway exports don't need the outcome start and end dates
					specified.</para>

					was processed into onCourse, or the course start date, which ever is
					earlier.</para>
				<para>In the NAT00120 an enrolment identifier is added, using the record ID of the
					outcome. This value is not visible or editable in the onCourse user interface.
					This means once you have reported a student via AVETMISS you should not cancel
					and re-enrol them as their unique ID will change.</para>
				<para>In the NAT00120 the 'Client Fees - other' is always exported as $0. There is
					no corresponding field for this value in onCourse.</para>
				<para>In the NAT00120 the Delivering Training RTO ABN is always exported as the RTO
					ABN from the general preferences. </para>
				<para>The NAT00130 will automatically create a record for a student enrolled in a

		<title>Validating and correcting AVETMISS errors</title>
		<para>Prior to exporting your AVETMISS data, you may wish to run some reports inside

			organisational data for other reporting and segmenting of your VET delivery.</para>
		<para>From the classes window, two CSV exports are available. CSV files can be opened in
			Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet applications. If you ever wished you could easily
			open and read NAT00120 files in Excel, consider this the next best thing.</para>
		<para>Begin by opening the classes window and locating the classes you wish to export,
			through the usual sorts, searches and filters. Once you have located and highlighted the
			classes in the list view choose File > Import/Export > Export Classes</para>
		<para>From the export format list options, choose either 'class outcomes CSV report' or
			'extended outcomes CSV'.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Class Outcomes CSV</title>
			<para>The purpose of this export is to show you all the outcomes and the outcome status

				been entered into onCourse.</para>
			<para>This report contains the onCourse student number, student first and last name,
				course-class code, unit of competency code and name, outcome start and end date and
				outcome status.</para>
			<para>Keep in mind this report is showing you the actual data in the onCourse records -
				when you export actual AVETMISS data from onCourse, the export runner values will
				set outcome status 90 for outcomes in progress, and outcome status 70 for outcomes
				that end in future calendar years. The value inside the database will remain as not

			<para>There are two places where you can set your State Funding Source codes. The first
				in on the VET tab of the class. This is a useful place to set the code when all (or
				most) of the students in the class have the same funding source applying to
				them.</para>
			<para>First you will need to make sure you have an up to date list of the appropriate
				State Funding Codes to use within your reporting state. onCourse doesn't maintain a
				list of these codes, you will need to contact your local reporting officer to obtain
				this information.</para>

			<para>If a student has a different funding code which applies to them, you can just
				change their enrolment funding codes to make it different to the one set at the
				class level. If all students in the class have different funding codes, you don't
				need to set anything at the class level, but can set each outcome separately on the
				enrolment general tab. </para>
			<para>Where the value populates from a record level above, you will see the value in the
				lower level record with the lock icon. In this case, it means the enrolment is
				inheriting the value from the level above, the class. You can click the unlock icon
				to change the value and break the inherited linked value from the class.</para>

			<title>How do I record a student's outcome who has completed a different elective from
				the rest of class?</title>
			<para>Once you have set up the outcomes at the Course level, every student enrolling in
				a Class from that Course will have all of the outcomes applied to their record. If a
				student chooses a different elective from the one you have set a the course level
				you can change their outcome so it is linked to a different Unit of
				Competency.</para>
			<para>You can do this by going into Class Outcome tab and double clicking on the outcome
				you wish to change. Type the Module code or Module name into the field and click OK
				to link to a new outcome.</para>
			<para>If you wish to add or delete an outcome from the student's record, you need to do
				this from the Enrolment Outcome tab. You will see a + and a - button in the top
				right hand corner. Use these to add or delete outcome records as required. </para>

			<title>How do I record information about a clients traineeship?</title>
			<para>When a student is completing a traineeship, you will have been given a 'Training
				Contract Identifier' and a Client 'Identifier' by your state funding body. They may
				call them by different names, but the important thing to confirm is that they are
				the data that exports into the NAT000120 in positions 70 &amp; 80
				respectively.</para>
			<para>This data is entered into the onCourse enrolment window. This data will need to be
				entered after enrolment by going to the Enrolment window, locating the student's
				enrolment record and double clicking on it. On the general tab you will find these
				fields.</para>
			<para>In NSW, you will need to put your Training Contract ID into BOTH of these fields,
				as NSW doesn't issue a separate Client Identifier for trainees.</para>
			<para>If you have broken the traineeship into multiple enrolments, each with one or more
				units of competency, you will need to enter this information into each enrolment
				record for the student that relates to the traineeship. This information is not
				recorded as part of the student's master contact record, as the student may also
				have other enrolment records which don't form part of this traineeship.</para>

			<title>Why do some outcomes in the NAT000120 export with start and end dates of
				00000000?</title>
			<para>This is a date that has not been defined, e.g. instead of exporting an eight digit
				date like 01012012, it has exported no date, or a string of zeros as
				placeholders.</para>
			<para>What this means is that the class the outcome belongs to has no sessions defined.
				With no sessions, there are no start or end dates available. Also, if you have a
				self paced class where you have not defined the duration, the start date will be the
				date of enrolment as usual, but the end date will default to 12 months after the
				start date.</para>
			<para>Look for any unscheduled or self paced classes in your onCourse records, and add
				either some session information or manual start and end dates to each outcome in the
				class.</para>

			<title>Why, in the AVETMISS export, do my non-VET courses have codes like ISH123?</title>
			<para>In onCourse version 5.0 we increased the Course Code field length to 32
				characters, to give onCourse Web users more SEO choices for the URL that was created
				for their course page.</para>
			<para>The AVETMISS standard NAT00060 allows for up to 12 characters in the 'subject identifier
				text'. We also have some users who have to report to other government bodies which
				further restrict them to using 8 or 10 of these available characters only as they
				append their own codes to this field.</para>
			<para>While we require course codes in onCourse to be unique, if we only exported the
				first 8 characters of user defined course code, we could very easily end up
				exporting two courses with duplicate codes that then causes an AVETMISS validation
				error. Take, for example course codes ComputerClassSeniors and ComputerClassOpen,
				both which are valid in onCourse and create good URLs like
				www.mycollegename.com.au/course/ComputerClassSeniors and
				www.mycollegename.com.au/course/ComputerClassOpen. </para>
			<para>Exporting the first 8, 10 or 12 characters for these courses would give us the
				identical code 'Computer', 'ComputerCl' or 'ComputerClas', all of which would be
				duplicates. Instead of this possible duplication, we export a made up code that will
				look something like ISH123 and will not ever create duplicate records in the export. </para>
			<para>Keep in mind, that for courses that aren't linked to training packages, the code
				reported in AVETMISS here has no meaning at all - it just has to be a unique
				identifier within your organisation. These 'made up' codes only affect your non-VET
				courses - real VET enrolments are always referenced to the unit(s) of competency
				they student enrolled in</para>
			<para>This does mean if you need to follow up another sort of validation error
				referencing an enrolment in ISH123 you'll need to check your NAT00060 export file to
				see that ISH123, for example is the export code for the course with the name
				'Introduction to Computers for Seniors'.</para>
			<para>As always, we walk the line in meeting the best business, sales and marketing
				functions for your college AND meeting the AVETMISS requirements in the most
				non-onerous way we can. Where these two needs conflict, we will try and code our way
				around it in the export process so we that don't stop you doing what you want in the
				onCourse software.</para>

			<title>How does prior learning affect AVETMISS reports?</title>
			<para>Prior learning records only export from AVETMISS exports run from the file >
				import/export >export AVETMISS menu option. They will not export from the cogwheel
				option in the classes or enrolments window, because they are not associated with
				either a class or an enrolment, but instead are attached directly to the
				student.</para>
			<para>When you create a prior learning record with one or more outcomes attached, and the start
				and end dates of the prior learning outcomes fall into the 'outcomes after' to
				-'outcomes before' date range set in the AVETMISS export runner, then the data
				associated with the prior learning record will export.</para>
			<para>At a minimum, to create successful AVETMISS files your prior learning outcomes
				need, in addition to a start date and end date, an outcome status. All other values
				are optional.</para>
			<para>If a Delivery Mode is not set, 'classroom based' will export as the default,
				unless the outcome has an RPL status, in which case the delivery mode ' not
				applicable' will export.</para>
			<para>If the Funding Source - national is not set, then the default funding source set
				in the college preferences will be applied.</para>
			<para>If the prior learning record was linked to a qualification or skills set, then the
				Commencing Program Identifier will export as '3 - commencing enrolment', otherwise
				it will export as '8 - module only enrolment'. </para>
			<para>If the prior learning record was linked to a qualification or skills set, then the
				Study Reason Identifier will export as '11 - other reasons'.</para>
			<para>The VET in Schools flag will always export as No.</para>
			<para>The training location for all prior learning outcomes will be set to your college
				default administration site address.</para>
