     <title>Accounting best practices</title>
     <para>There are many ways to structure your accounts and your circumstances may differ from the
        practices here. That's fine, as long as you get the results you need and have sufficient
        checks and balances. Accounting typically has three main goals: tax, audit and management.
        It will help if you don't mix them up. For example, the management reports are all done on
        an accrual basis in order to understand the true position of your business, while auditing
        mostly focusses on cash movements.</para>
    <section><title>Management</title>
    <para>Typical management reports focus on profitability of individual classes and across areas
            of the business. In onCourse you would select sets of classes using a combination of
            advanced search for choosing date ranges and tags for choosing a reporting group. You
            might also choose a set of students based on age, postcode, enrolment history,
            membership, concessions, etc and then use the 'related records' feature to find
            enrolments or invoices for those students.</para>
        <para>onCourse has budget and discount takeup reports, both at a detailed class level and
            across subjects.</para>
        <para>You might export enrolment or invoice data and open the results in Excel in order to
            perform further analysis and graphing. If these are commonly used Excel transformations
            then write a custom onCourse export script or report. Absolutely anything you can do in
            Excel can be done inside onCourse's reporting and exporting engine.</para>
        <para>We haven't mentioned the onCourse general ledger yet, because most management
            micro-analysis is better done by looking at the source data in onCourse: classes grouped
            by tags, discounts, budget and gross profit. We do not recommend allocating fixed costs
            inside onCourse's budget; they add nothing to your understanding of the gross profit
            position at the class level and don't help your planning of which classes are worth
            running.</para>
        <para>To achieve whole-of-business reporting (including those fixed costs), with an accurate
            P&amp;L and Balance Sheet, you should regularly journal the onCourse Trial Balance data
            to your finance system (Xero, MYOB, Quick Books, Moneyworks, PeopleSoft, etc). Many of
            our customers do this once a month, but some do it daily with script automation.</para>
        <para>onCourse does not have a concept of terms or semesters and it is our advice that you
            don't use them as your primary reporting period. Modern adult education is moving toward
            more continual delivery; asking students to wait 3-6 months before they can enrol may
            drive them to your competitors with more flexible scheduling. If you really need to, you
            can use tags in onCourse to group classes in terms, but you may instead like to report
            on months or quarters instead for similar results with much less administration.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Tax</title>
        <para>onCourse is a deferred accrual accounting system. That means that income isn't
            recognised until the class is delivered, which works well in deferring your tax
            liability until as late as possible. This is also best practice because it aligns the
            bulk of your costs (payroll) with your income.</para>
        <para>However onCourse does not currently defer your GST liability, so that is posted at the
            creation of the invoice. If you hold a significant amount in debtors, and you'd like to
            defer your GST liability to a cash basis, you will currently have to estimate that
            manually. Whether you are allowed to do this may depend on the type and size of your
            organisation.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Audit</title>
        <para>It is important not to confuse auditing processes with managment accounting reporting.
            Good audit control will often focus on cash handling and tracking. Trying to overlay
            income accounts over your cash reports, and thereby convert your accounting to a cash
            basis, will be painful. onCourse is an accrual accounting system, so a partial payment
            against an invoice with multiple invoice lines each with different income accounts will
            be difficult to convert accurately from accrual to cash.</para>
        <para>We therefore advise you follow these processes to ensure your cash is tracked through
            the system:</para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Minimise the number of people with full admin access to onCourse and who
                        are able to create refunds, perform banking, change the chart of accounts
                        and perform other accounting functions.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Set up 'payment types' that mirror your real options. You may like to
                        create a special payment type for 'internal journal' if other departments
                        can pay you internally. Also government funding (Smart &amp; Skilled, VET
                        FEE HELP, etc) can also benefit from their own payment type.</para>

                    <para>If you keep POS terminals, disable their ability to perform refunds.
                        Because they allow you to refund any card to any amount, they can be
                        dangerous. onCourse will only allow you to refund cards from which you
                        already received funds and only up to the amount you previously
                        received.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>Ensure your team is performing banking regularly and not holding unbanked
                        cash and cheques. You can set up an alert in onCourse when payments remain
                        unbanked for longer than you are happy.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>Regularly reconcile the banking in onCourse against your bank account. You
                        don't need to wait to the end of the month and a printed bank statement to
                        do this. If there are discrepencies between the onCourse settlement date and
                        the actual settlement date this is a good time to adjust the dates in
                        onCourse to match (feature available in onCourse 8.20).</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>You may consider setting up a separate bank account for your inbound
                        payments from student fees. This represents the funds held in trust for
                        classes not yet delivered (whether or not it is an actual trust
                        account).</para>
