    <section xml:id="FEEHELP-whatIs"><title>What are VET Student Loans?</title><para>In the onCourse context, VET Student Loans are a type of database export and reporting
            standard for students enrolled in courses for which they can apply for a government
            study loan. Prior to January 1 2017, this scheme was known as VET FEE-HELP</para><para>More information about
            the current reporting standard can be found on the <link

        <para>VET Student Loans are available to assist eligible students studying approved Diploma
            level and above VET Qualifications to pay their tuition fees. Part, or all, of an
            eligible student's tuition fees can be deferred into VET Student Loan, up to a capped
            amount. Some Government funded course fees can also be deferred under the VET Student
            Loan scheme.</para>
            <para>An RTO needs to be pre-approved to offer VET Student Loans on some or all of their
            courses. If you are an approved RTO, onCourse Fee Help functions will enable you to meet
            your reporting and record keeping obligations.</para><para>Set your Fee Help Provider Code in the AVETMISS general preferences panel to export your VET

        <title>Creating a VET Student Loan eligible class</title>
        <para>Creating the VET Student Loan course may involve creating a single course, for a full
            qualification, with all appropriate units of competency attached, if your course is
            delivered as a single program with one census date. This is generally no longer allowed,
            and in most cases you will need multiple courses, to represent multiple units of
            study.</para>
        <para>Where your VET Student Loan course contains multiple subjects, each with one or more
            unit, and with varying census dates, you'll need to create the appropriate number of
            onCourse courses, and at least one VET Student Loan eligible class for each
            course.</para>
        <para>The data you set in the course and the class records is combined with student and
            enrolment data to create the VET Student Enrolment (VEN), VET Enrolment Revisions (VER),
            VET Load Liability (VLL), VET Unit of Study Completions (VCU), VET Course Completions
            (VCC) and VET Commonwealth Assisted Students - HELP Due (VDU) export files.</para>

        <para>For all students enrolled in a class where VET Student Loans are available, every

        <para>There are some additional fields in the VET tab of a contact record that need to be

        <para>Every enrolment record has a VET Student Loans  tab that is used to record the VET
            Student Loan request, or report that the student doesn't wish to apply for a loan. </para>
        <para>The fee charged field will show the enrolment fee the student was charged. This data
            is tied to the invoices generated is not editable in their enrolment record.</para>
        <para>In the FEE HELP requested field, you can indicate that the student doesn't wish to
            apply for a loan by leaving the default value as $0.00 or enter an amount up to the full
            class fee.</para>
        <para>The loan fee will be calculated based on the value you have set in the Fee Subsidy
            drop down box. Non-state government subsidised courses will incur a 20% loan fee that
            you'll see added to the Total Loan amount. Subsidised courses incur no loan fee.</para>
        <para>You can also override the Type of Attendance information at the enrolment level. By
            default, the enrolment will inherit the attendance type of the class, but you can change
            it here if you have students attending the same class, but with different attendance
            types.</para>
