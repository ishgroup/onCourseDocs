            is the reporting standard used to collect data from registered private providers.
            AVETMISS information is extracted from RAPT to meet the local and national timetables
            for vocational education and training enrolment statistics reporting</para>
        <para>All publicly funded data reporting is submitted directly to DTWD, the State Training Authority (STA) in WA via current RAPT reporting requirements.</para>
        <para>The RAPT formatted data is like a cut down version of AVETMISS, and includes student
            enrolment information like their USI.</para>

                onCourse classes and outcomes created by importing data into onCourse (prior

            <para>If you only want to select student enrolment data for a specific class group, or for selected enrolments, you can begin the RAPT export process from either the class or enrolment window.</para>
            <para>Start by highlighting the particular classes or enrolments in the list view, and
                then go to the cogwheel in the top right hand corner and select the option 'AVETMISS

            <para>As per the instructions for exporting all training activity above, a sheet will
                open. When you are exporting from the classes or enrolment cogwheel option, however,
                you do not have to enter a date range.</para>
            <para>It is still important that you select the AVETMISS flavour 'WA RAPT' in this

            can extract your AVETMISS data from onCourse via the AVETMISS standard to meet the total
            VET activity reporting (TVA) requirement in WA.</para>
            <para>Following the same instructions as 'Exporting all training activity to RAPT'
                above, but this time selecting the flavour 'AVETMISS standard' will export the
                standard AVETMISS files you then need to upload to AVS for validation and

        <title>Client Qualifications Register (CQR) Reporting</title>
        <para>The Client Qualifications Register (CQR) is a system for the permanent recording of
            ​Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) student records from RTOs. </para>
        <para>Therefore in the event that an RTO ceases to trade, students will still have access to
            their records and employers will be able to verify qualifications. </para>
        <para>WA RTOs are required to submit information on student achievements to TAC via the CQR.
            RTOs need to provide data on achievement at the unit of competency and the qualification
            level as well as provide some minimal student information for identification purposes.
            Reporting is due biannually as follows: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>student achievement data for January to June is due by 31 July </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>student achievement data for July to December is due by 31 January.​ </para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        
        <para>The CQR system is accessible only through RTONet . Instructions on how to submit CQR
            data to TAC can be found in the <link xlink:href="http://www.tac.wa.gov.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/Fact%20Sheet%20-%20RTO%20Reporting%20Requirements%20V02-15.pdf">RTO reporting requirements​​ fact sheet​​.</link> ​</para>
        <para>To export this data from onCourse, begin by opening the certificate window from
            Activity > Certificates.</para>
        <para> Once in the certificate window you can export the required data by following the
            steps below:</para>
