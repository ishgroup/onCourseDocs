	<para>The following chapter provides an overview of the principles of the onCourse financial
		process, as well as clear explanations as to how you get the information you need from
		onCourse in order to obtain your monthly / weekly reports. </para>
	<section xml:id="accounting-Relationship">
		<title>Relationship between the Student and the Debtor within onCourse</title>
		<para>onCourse has a clear separation between financial data and enrolment data. Students
			enrol in classes. Students may not be a company, since only natural people can enrol in
			a class. The contact linked to an invoice (the debtor) may however be a company or a
			natural person. The student and the debtor may be the same person; this often happens
			for a simple enrolment of one person into one class. The student and the debtor could be
			two different people, or in fact a debtor could pay for the enrolment of multiple
			students on one invoice.</para>
		<para>In the following example of a basic enrolment, there are 2 students Peter and Amy, and the
			invoice is issued to the debtor Geoff (1). Geoff then pays the full amount (2).</para>

		<para>If an enrolment needs to be cancelled for whatever reason, the cancellation process
			will generate a credit note to the debtor. It is important to note that although Peter
			might phone to cancel his enrolment, the credit can only be issued back to Geoff in
			onCourse.</para>

		<title>Principles of Accrual Accounting</title>
		<para>onCourse works on the principle of accrual accounting, which means that the income is
			recorded to the General Ledger (GL) at the point the invoice has been generated,
			irrespective of when the payment is received. The following diagrams illustrate the
			difference between accrual accounting and cash accounting and the point at which income
			is recorded against the GL.</para>
		<para> You will note also that the income that is received will initially be assigned to a
			liability account, then transferred to the income account once the class commences. For
			further information see the Deferred Income section of the user handbook.</para>

		<title>Explanation of Financial Transactions Generated by the System</title>
		<para>onCourse follows the basic concepts of double-entry accounting: all financial
			transactions are written to the general ledger in balanced pairs. Asset and expense sit
			on the left, and liability and income on the right. So an increase in Asset could be
			matched with an equal decrease in another Asset. An increase in Expense might be matched
			by an equal increase in Liability.</para>

				<title>Transactions created when a COS discount is applied</title>
				<para>For each discount created, you can choose to either charge the discount to a Cost of Sale
					(COS) account so you can track the discount as a business expense, or to allow
					the discount to reduce the income received. Manual discounts given at the point
					of sale, by overriding the class fee in Quick Enrol, are always posted as
					reduced income, and will not post to the COS account(s)</para>
				<para>Generally, discounts like promotional codes are better set up as COS discounts, while
					variable course fees for differently funded students are better set up as
					discounts which reduce income. Discounts which aren't linked to a COS post the
					reduced income as per the standard liability > income processes.</para>
				<para>By default, Discounts linked to a COS account are charged to an account called Discounts
					Given. You can also create additional COS accounts as needed for different
					departments or promotional types. The transactions processed to this account,
					and balance of this account allow you to keep an accurate track of the cost to
					the business of the discounts given during the sales process. To determine the
					income earned, you can deduct the balance of the COS accounts(s) from the
					appropriate income account(s).</para>
				<para>Discounts work in conjunctions with the standard enrolment transaction posting process,
					and the deferred income posting for income.</para>
				<para>For example, for a $300 (GST free) enrolment fee, with a $100 COS discount applied at time
					of enrolment, the student owes and pays the balance of $200 in full during
					enrolment. </para>
				<simplelist>
					<member>(1) $200 is recorded as pre-paid fees liability. This is the income for
						the full enrolment, excluding the discounted amount</member>
					<member>(2) $200 is recorded as owing in the trade debtors account. </member>
					<member> (3) $100, the value of the discount, is posted to the classes set
						income account </member>
					<member> (4) $100, the value of the discount is posted to the COS sale account
						Discounts Given </member>
					<member> (5) The student pays the balance of the enrolment fee, $200 and the cheque account,
						also known as the deposited funds account, is credited with the Trade Debtor
						account is debited. The student has now paid in full and owes no further
						money.</member>
					<member> (6) When the class commences (or other choice of setting) the remaining
						income, $200, from the enrolment is debited from the pre-paid fees liability
						and credited to the income account set for the class. </member>

			<title>Financial Transactions Generated by Enrolment Cancellation Process</title>
			<para>When canceling an enrolment a credit note is issued, this results in the opposite
				effect to the original invoice. Note that this does not automatically generate a

				enrolment or choose to have it paid to them in one of a number of ways.</para>
			<para>If you need to cancel an enrolment or enrolments for a Class that has not yet
				commenced, the cancellation process will trigger the deferred income held in the
				Prepaid Fees Liability Account to be transferred to the income account. This
				transfer is the first part of the cancellation process. </para>
			<tip>
				<para>If an enrolment or enrolments are cancelled after the Class has commenced, the
					remainder / balance of funds will be transferred from the Prepaid Fees Liability
					Account to the Income account, this is triggered by the cancellation

			<title>Vouchers and Financial Transactions </title>
			<para>Vouchers are a mechanism to pre-purchase access to training before the user has
				selected a product and in effect, have credit available to redeem at a point of
				their choosing up until the voucher automatically expires. For more information on
				creating and selling vouchers, refer to the <link xlink:href="vouchers.html">Vouchers chapter.</link></para>
			<para>All voucher sales are non-taxable supply, as the GST component can not be
				determined until the voucher is redeemed and onCourse knows if the product chosen
				has GST applied or is GST free. Voucher sales are grouped on invoices under the
				heading 'The following items are not a taxable supply'. </para>
			<para>When a voucher is purchased, the purchase price of the voucher is held in a
				liability account until such time as the voucher is redeemed or expired. The choice
				of liability account is set in your financial preferences, but by default will be
				called Voucher Liability.</para>
			<para>As a voucher can be sold for less than it's redemption value, or given away for
				free, the difference between the sale cost and the redemption cost will be
				calculated as a Cost of Sale and charge to your chosen account for Voucher
				Underpayment. </para>
			<para>At the point of redemption, a voucher acts as a payment in method, and behaves
				like cash, cheque or card. Mixed payments can be made during redemption if the
				voucher balance doesn't cover the full cost of sale.</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member> (1) In this example a voucher is sold for $200 with a redemption value of
					$200. When the voucher is purchased, an invoice is raised for the sale price.
					The Trade Debtors account is increased.</member>
				<member> (2) The sale price of the voucher increases the Voucher Liability account
					by the same amount. If the voucher was given away for free, the sale price would
					be $0.</member>
				<member> (3) When the invoice for the voucher is paid for, the Cheque Account, also known as the
					deposited funds account, is increased by the value of the payment made.</member>
				<member> (4) The Trade Debtors account is reversed by the value of the payment in
					for the invoice. Vouchers do not have to be 'paid for' to be redeemable. Your
					invoice payment terms for vouchers can be negotiable as per all your invoice
					terms.</member>
				<member> (5) A student enrols in a class and the cost of the enrolment fee is posted
					to the Trade Debtors account as per any other invoice created</member>
				<member> (6) The income component of the class fee is posted to the Prepaid Fees
					Liability account if the class has not yet commenced, as per all
					enrolments</member>
				<member> (7) The voucher is used as a payment method. In this example, the total
					invoice balance outstanding is $264, but the voucher is only valid for $200. The
					Trade Debtors account is debited by the value of the voucher.</member>
				<member> (8) The Voucher Liability account is debited by the sale price of the
					voucher. There is no Voucher Liability (or credit available to the voucher
					holder) remaining.</member>
				<member> (9) The balance outstanding of the invoice is paid by another payment
					method such as cash or credit card</member>
				<member> (10) The Trade Debtors asset is reduced by the amount paid in the previous
					step. The amount payable on the invoice created on enrolment is now $0.</member>

					When the voucher is purchased, an invoice is raised for the sale price. The

				<member> (2) The sale price of the voucher increases the Voucher Liability account

	<section xml:id="accounting-contraPaymentTypes">
		<title>Contra Payment Types for Refunds</title>
		<para>A contra payment is a special type of payment that debits the balance outstanding on
			an invoice with the balance of an available credit note. It saves you from having to
			look at the total balance of a student's debits and credits and works out what their end
			position is. It may be especially useful for companies who process multiple students in
			an invoice and have some students cancel and credited.</para>
		<para>This works automatically for a credit note and is created through the enrolment
			cancellation process. For example, if the student had enrolled, but not paid their
			class, which was later cancelled and you issued them a credit note, automatically both
			the credit note and their original invoice would have a $0 balance, as they would cancel
			each other out.</para>
		<mediaobject>

			<caption>
				<para>Create a contra invoice via the invoice window advanced function
					cogwheel</para>
			</caption>
		</mediaobject>
		<para>Alternatively, you can do this manually in the invoice window for manual credit notes
			too. For example, if a student had an invoice for $100 for an enrolment that they have
			not made a payment against, so have a balance outstanding of $100, and there then issued
			a credit note for $70 for a manual refund for a different class that they had paid for,
			you could choose to 'contra' the $70 credit note balance against the $100 outstanding
			balance on the invoice. This would then show their credit note as having a $0 balance
			(as though you had refunded them, or they had used the credit note for another
			enrolment) and their invoice as having a balance of $30 outstanding that they need to
			pay. </para>
		<para>You can only use credit notes to contra invoices for the same contact. You can't take
			a credit note from Student A and use it to 'pay off' an invoice that was issued to
			Student B.</para>

			<title>How Deferred Incomes Works</title>
			<para>When an invoice is generated within onCourse, those funds are initially listed
				within the GL against the Pre Paid Fees (Liability account). These funds are then
				transferred to the income account of the GL at the commencement of the Class. </para>
			<para>As you can see from the above diagram, the method by which onCourse determines how
				the deferred income is transferred across from the Pre Paid Fees (liability) account
				is as follows.<simplelist>
					<member>(1) First session of class is run</member>
					<member>(2) At approximately 1am the following morning, the system will run a
						comparison between the amount of funds in the liability account and the
						amount of funds in the income account for that Class. It will also check how
						many hours of the overall Class have been run and how many are yet to be
						run</member>
					<member>(3) Based on the above comparison, onCourse automatically transfers an
						instalment of funds from the Pre Paid Fees account to the Income
						account.</member>
					<member>(4) This nightly comparison will continue for the duration of the Class
						until all remaining funds are transferred from the Pre Paid Fees account to
						the Income account.</member>
				</simplelist></para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>What Happens If I have to Cancel or Add a Session to a Class? </title>
			<para>As you would have noted within the previous section, onCourse runs a nightly
				comparison of the amount of funds in the Pre Paid Fees account against the amount of
				funds in the Income account.</para>
			<para>If for example you have to cancel a session within a given Class, the next time
				the system does an overnight check of the status, it will allow for this
				cancellation and transfer all remaining funds to the Income account. </para>
			<para>Alternatively, if you have to add additional sessions to a Class, the system will
				adjust the nightly installment of funds being transferred to allow for the increased
				number of total hours in the given Class. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>What if I want all funds to be transferred at the commencement of the
				Class?</title>
			<para>A College may decide that they do not wish to transfer income incrementally across
				the duration of a given Class.</para>
			<para>If you don't want to use this feature within onCourse, you can easily deactivate
				this within the Financial Preferences of your onCourse client.</para>
			<para>By choosing to not assign funds from liability to income in nightly increments,
				the system will instead transfer all funds from the Pre Paid Fees account to the
				Income account the night after the first session of the Class is run. </para>
			<para>Please note that this setting is universal, so all Classes are either assigned
				funds incrementally across the duration of the Class, or the funds are transferred
				in one installment after the first session of the Class is completed. </para>

		<title>Accessing Financial Information from onCourse</title>
		<para>When running any kind of query against onCourse to extract financial information, keep
			in mind that enrolment information is attached to the student and all financial
			information (such as invoices / payments / credit notes) are attached to the debtor
			within the system. Therefore there is no direct data relationship between the student
			and the debtor.</para>
		<para>There are multiple methods you can use to extract / examine financial information
			within onCourse;</para>
		<section>
			<title>Automated reporting from scripts</title>
			<para>An automated weekly or monthly Trial Balance report from onCourse is available by enabling
				the script 'send weekly finance summary report'.</para>
			<para>By default, this script is set up to run every Monday morning. It prints to PDF and emails
				the Trial Balance report for the previous 7 days to the default system administrator
				email address. You can make the following changes in the script to meet your
				requirements:</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Change the email address receiving the report</emphasis> The
				default system administrator email address is the one you have set in General
				Preferences > Messaging. If this is not the email address you want to use, change

			to "accounts@mycollege.com.au"</programlisting></para>
			<para>Where "accounts@mycollege.com.au" is the email address of the person who should receive the
				report, being sure to include the speech marks. </para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Change from weekly to monthly automated reports</emphasis> To make
				this change you need to make some changes to the code in the script, and also the
				CRON. The CRON is the scheduler that defines how often the script runs. By default
				the CRON is 3am every Monday morning:</para>
			<para><programlisting language="groovy">0 0 3 ? * MON</programlisting></para>
			<para>Change it to 3am the 1st of every month:</para>

			<title>Locating data using related records</title>
			<para>In all onCourse windows, you can track through the relationships between the data
				using the 'Find related' function in the cogwheel in the top right hand corner. For
				example, if you wanted to find all the invoices related to the payments in taken on
				a given day, you can select all the payment in records for the day, go to the
				cogwheel, selected 'Find related...' and select invoices. This will open all the
				related invoices in a new window.</para>
			<para>In the new Invoices window, you can run additional queries and or print reports.
				This window has opened in a special state that only ever shows the maximum set of
				results as being the list the generated from your original find related search, so
				all your searches, filters and reports will only relate to this subset of data until
				you close the Invoice list window.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Printed Financial Reports</title>
			<para>onCourse comes with a number of different Financial Reports and each of these are
				looking at one particular aspect or area of the database such as Invoices. You may
				also wish to analyze the financial information that is being generated and you can
				do this by comparing information from one report to the next. </para>
			<para>For example, a data comparison that will enable you to verify the accuracy of the financial
				information is the deposited funds account,balance = Payment in - Payment out for
				the same time period.</para>
			<para>New Custom Reports can be developed upon request, just bear in mind the rules of
				how the data is structured within onCourse when considering what kind of information
				you want to have appear on the Report.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Copying info within list view windows to Excel</title>
			<para>Copy and paste list view records into excel. Run your desired query within a given
				window, hi-light the records you want in the list window and copy. Open excel to
				paste records.</para>
			<para>The benefit of this approach is that it allows you to copy information from a
				number of different windows on to the same excel worksheet in order to better
				compare and verify the data.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>CSV Exports</title>
			<para>onCourse enables you to export data directly from onCourse. As is the case with
				the printed reports, these exports are essentially flat tables of data, which means
				that you are only looking at one specific area such as invoices .</para>
			<para>For more information regarding exporting financial data from onCourse, refer to
				the chapter on <link xlink:href="importExport.html">Importing and
				Exporting</link>.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Exporting to MYOB</title>
			<para>onCourse allows you to generate a text file export of your Financial Data in order
				to import this information directly into MYOB. For more information regarding
				exporting data for MYOB, refer to the following section of the Import Export Chapter
				on <link xlink:href="importExport.html#importExport-MYOB">Exporting to
				MYOB.</link></para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Running Queries Directly from the Database</title>
			<para>It is possible within onCourse to run queries on information directly from the
				database server. Whether the server runs on Apache Derby or MySQL or MS SQL all of
				these relational databases allow you to query the database directly.</para>
			<para>This allows you write and edit your own custom reports on demand. Instructions are
				available <link xlink:href="http://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/2.0/manual/reports.html"> in
					the reports documentation </link> for downloading and installing a free SQL tool
				for writing your own reports. A high level of familiarity with SQL is required to
				use this function - it is not part of the standard onCourse product support, but an
				advanced option which is also available for your own use. If you do not have these
				skills in house, custom reports can be created for you on request by ish. A quote
				will be provided for each report. </para>
			<para>From an accountancy perspective, what type of relational database you use is not
				important, the thing you want to be clear about is knowing exactly what data you
				need to see and how you want to see it. </para>
			<para>As an example, if your company wants to run a monthly query against the database which
				tells you all payments received, for which enrolments within a give time frame, you
				would follow these 4 basic steps.</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member>(1) Define the data you wish to include in your query. It could be the
					invoice number, invoice date, course code and enrolled student first name and
					last name.</member>
				<member>(2) Define how you want this query to appear, which is as simple as setting
					up your columns within an excel worksheet. By defining this, you are determining
					the relationship between the data.</member>
				<member>(3) Define the date range of the query (in other words, set the date
					range)</member>
				<member>(4) Run the resulting query against the database</member>
			</simplelist>
			<para>If you run the same query on a monthly basis, once you have worked out Step 1 and
				2, the only thing you need to do to run the query each month is to update the date
				range. Once this query has been run, you can then import this directly into an excel
				document and you are ready to go.</para>

		<title>Banking and Reconciliation</title>
		<para>In the onCourse preferences, multiple payment types can be created, in addition to the
			system payment types already defined by onCourse.</para>
		<para>For each payment type, you can define if the payment type is banked automatically or
			manually, and if the payment type is reconcilable, and which asset account the payment
			is deposited into prior to banking, and moved to after banking.</para>
		<para>By default, an asset account named 'undeposited funds' is where all manually banked payments
			are deposited on creation. The asset account 'deposited funds' is where all
			automatically banked payments are deposited on creation, and where all manually banked
			payments are moved to when they are banked.</para>
		<para>Automatically and manually banked payments are grouped where possible into daily totals.
			These banking deposits can then be reconciled as a group, or where needed, transaction
			by transaction.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Banking</title>
			<para>As onCourse is integrated with a credit card payment gateway, the system will automatically
				settle payments in and payments out received via the credit card gateway, whether
				these payments are processed through your office or via website enrolments. This
				settlement process is automatically done between 7pm and 9pm each evening and will
				be deposited into your nominated merchant account the following business day as a
				single sum. If a payment is processed into onCourse after the nightly settlement cut
				off time, the payment will not be banked or appear in your nominated account until
				the day after. The grouping of the deposited credit card bankings in onCourse will
				match the batching of the deposits processed by your bank.</para>
			<para>If you accept AMEX credit cards, these payment types will be grouped and deposited in a
				separate banking deposit in onCourse. This is because the AMEX settlement process
				works differently to Mastercard &amp; Visa, and does not always settle on a daily
				basis. Instead it is dependent on the value of the transactions you have
				processed.</para>
			<para>If you have an EFTPOS terminal that you use in conjunction with, or instead of the onCourse
				credit card gateway, ensure you select EFTPOS, rather than EFT or credit card, as
				the payment in type, even if you have processed a credit card through the terminal.
				EFTPOS transactions will be marked as banked on creation, and like your onCourse
				credit card gateway, will be settled automatically into your bank account
				overnight.</para>
			<para>For payments received via Cheque, Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), Money Order or Cash, a
				manual banking process will group and deposit these transactions. The 'Deposit
				Banking' function within the onCourse client allows you to track the date of
				settlement, method of payment, payment amount and staff member who performs this
				function. It also ensures that you do not 'double count' any funds to your nominated
				bank account.</para>

				<title>How to manually deposit banking</title>
				<para>Manual banking is done a site by site basis. As in, each physical site where manual
					payment types are collected should run it's own banking process. You can see the
					site you are logged in to as user in the onCourse dashboard. If you wish to
					process the banking for an alternate site, you need to change your location on
					the dashboard first. Usually, an administration manager at each site would be
					responsible for running the bank process at their site.</para>
				<para>You should collect all your payments received and confirm you have the same
					cash balance and cheques indicated in the bank deposit window as you complete
					this process.</para>

			<para>Reconciliation can be done on a whole of deposit basis, which is preferable for grouped
				automatically deposited payments, like onCourse gateway credit card payments, or a
				payment by payment basis, which is preferable for payment types like cheque
				deposits, or EFT.</para>
			<para>In the Financial menu, select the option 'Banking deposits'. This lists all the
				grouped banking deposits recorded. You can double click on one of these entries and
				reconcile the whole deposit by ticking 'reconcile this banking deposit', or tick
				individual payment records as reconciled within the transaction. When all the
				payments have been ticked, the whole banking deposit will be ticked as reconciled
				automatically.</para>
			<para>If you prefer to reconcile from a printed report, you can also select a range of banking
				deposit records e.g. the complete calendar month, matching your bank account

		<title>FAQ: I want cash accounting</title>
		<para>We are asked for this a lot by colleges who migrate to onCourse. Often it is because that's
			how they did things in their old accounting system or on bits of paper. Usually the
			conversation starts like this:</para>
		<para><quote>I get how onCourse works, and it looks great, but I really want to report the class
				name, code and income account alongside every payment. Surely onCourse can tell me
				what every payment was for!</quote></para>
		<para>In a <emphasis role="bold">Cash Accounting</emphasis> system, this is slightly easier. You
			only assign income to your general ledger once you receipt payment. And at that point
			you decide where to post that income in your P&amp;L, breaking it up by account code as
			required. An <emphasis role="bold">Accrual Accounting</emphasis> system is more complex
			but also much more accurate. onCourse goes a step further and can be described as a
				<emphasis role="bold">Deferred Accrual Accounting</emphasis> system. Let's look at
			what that means.</para>
		<para>Jane enrols in a class with you for $500 plus $50 GST. Her friend Bob enrols in
			another class for $435 with no GST. They enrol together on the same invoice under Jane's
			name. First, that $50 immediately goes to a liability since it is payable immediately to
			the tax office. Even before you receipt the payment. That's a nuisance for your cash
			flow, but at least the ATO gives you 22-50 days to pay. At the same time you have an
			asset (Jane owes you $985) and a liability ($935 worth of training needs to be
			delivered).</para>
		<para>Now Jane pays you $130 first installment. So if you wanted your 'cash payment income'
			report what would go on it? What happens if they $130 payment also finished paying off a
			previous invoice for $17.50 and only $112.50 was toward the new invoice?</para>
		<para>Now you might cry "Oh, that never happens. Our accounts are simpler than that." But
			onCourse can't make those assumptions and we certainly can't generate reports and
			exports which are sometimes wrong because of assumptions that no one ever partially pays
			an invoice or pays two invoices at once or invoices only ever have one invoice
			line.</para>
		<para>So how do you solve this? Separate your financial management reporting from your cash
			reconciliation audit. Don't mix them up. Look at your trial balance in onCourse to make
			management decisions. Look at detailed budget reports from the class list to analyse
			which classes have problems and which areas are doing well. Then look at the banking
			list and associated reports to balance the cash in your bank against what should be
			there. But don't try and do management high level analysis of the money landing in your
			bank. It will not end well.</para>
