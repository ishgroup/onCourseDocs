				this field may be used are payroll numbers, licence numbers, student numbers that stay with
				the student between training organisations and date of initial contact. These fields can be
				made mandatory. You can add as many additional fields as you need to, that apply to contacts.
				These fields will appear on the bottom of the ‘general' tab in each contacts record.</para>

			<title>Concession types</title>
			<para>In many organisations and businesses, discounts are offered to customers based on special
				group membership or criteria such as students, special card holders etc.</para>
			<para>In onCourse, we can use Concession Types to define which groups of people have access to discounts by:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Associating the concession type to contact record by editing contacts/students;
						and</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Associating the concession type to a discount (see documentation on <link
						xlink:href="#discounts">creating
						discounts)</link></para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Some concession types may be available for your students to add to their own record during
				the online enrolment process, for example a Senior's Card. Other types you may want
				to restrict to only allowing the concession to be added to the student record via
				the onCourse client, for example College Staff. </para>
			<para>If you require an expiry date on the concession type, any discounts that apply to
				that concession type will not be available if the student's concession is
				expired.</para>
			<para>You may also choose to make entering a card number mandatory. Please note onCourse
				is not able to validate the authenticity of card numbers due. This is an open test
				field (string type) and will accept letters and numbers.</para>

			<title>Contact relation types</title>
			<para>You can define how you relate contacts to each other via contact relation types. Some types
				are already defined by default, but you can edit or delete them as needed.</para>
			<para>A relationship has two sides i.e. parent and child. Some times both sides will
				have the same name e.g. partner and partner. Relationships can be used to link
				contacts together for payment and enrolment purposes e.g. when an employer pays for
				their staff member, and also for marketing e.g. to define the HR Managers at
				companies you deliver training to, so you can promote up coming courses.</para>
			<para>To add or edit relationships, go to File > Preferences > Contact Relationship
				Types and create a new record.</para>

					If you create your own custom exports, or commission ish to create some on your behalf, you
					can add them to onCourse by clicking the <guibutton>+</guibutton>,  locating the export
					template on your computer, and importing it into onCourse. The template will be immediately
					added to the list. If the template already existed and this was just an updated template, then

			<para>The email templates include tags, or fields from the database which you can add or
				remove. If you edit the text in the tag name &lt;between these symbols> you will
				prevent the template from working correctly.</para>
			<para>These templates also require you to complete some contact details, for example the

			and "Access". Access rights restrict what parts of onCourse users can modify, print, view or
			delete. This is an advanced feature, available for onCourse "Professional and Enterprise"
			customers. Four pre-defined user roles are available within the system, Enrolment Officer,
			Administration Manager, Course Manager and Financial Manager. You can modify these and create
			new access rights groups as needed. Each user within your organisation can be given Admin
			access rights (full access) or be added to any of your access groups. Select the access rights

			<title>Setting up Active Directory (AD) authentication and authorisation.</title>
			<para>The below example has been completed with Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 and onCourse
				1.7.13. onCourse has the ability to use an external LDAP/AD server for authentication and
				authorisation, what we mean by this is that you do not need to use the onCourse user and
				group database but you can use your already setup AD database. Firstly on your Windows
				Server 2003 Machine go to "My Computer" right click and select "Properties" and you will
				find the following screen.</para>
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"
						fileref="images/Windows_2003_system_properties.png" format="png" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
			<para>Please take careful note of the "Full Computer Name" and the "Domain" as with this
				information you now have the building blocks for our configuration.</para>
			<para>Now the next thing we need to get the LDAP/AD authentication working is either the
				Administrator password or, a user account which is a member of the Administrators group.
				This is because when a query happens on the AD server it is required to login first before
				it can do any searches on users. If your administrators want to lock it down further they
				are welcome to do so, we only need read access to all user and group objects in the AD as
				well as the passwords for all of those users. So now we enter "Active Directory Users and
				Computers" and create our user: <mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"
							fileref="images/Create_a_win_2003_user.png" format="png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject> and add it to the administrators group and remember your password!</para>
			<para>Now we have everything we need! Complete the setup screen as follows:</para>
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"
						fileref="images/onCourse_LDAP_AD_screen_setup.png" format="png" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
			<para>Once you have substituted all of the settings as necessary press the "Test Connection"
				button to ensure that onCourse can bind to the LDAP server. Once that works, you can then go
				to the "Users" section of this configuration page and place "sAMAccountName" and
				(objectClass=user) for the search filter. Now test a user in your domain and see if it
				authenticates. If it works, congratulations you are now authenticating against your AD
				server!</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>AD Authorisation</title>
			<para>Authorisation is the process of giving your users the correct rights when they are
				logged in, this has a direct relationship with the different roles you can setup or create
				within onCourse. If you wish to use your AD server to allocate roles to your users, complete
				the following:</para>
			<para>At the top of your "Active Directory Users and Computers" create an "Organizational
				Unit" (OU) and call it "onCourse".</para>
			<para>In that OU create security groups which reflect the names of the roles in onCourse. Say
				for example the roles which are build into onCourse (you can find this in "File" -->
				"Preferences" --> "Access" in onCourse):</para>
			<para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Administration Manager</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Course Manager</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Enrolment Officer</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Financial Manager</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<para>You can add or delete roles here as you wish but a corresponding group must exist in AD
				for the authorisation/access rights to be allocated.</para>
			<para>When you have created those groups in AD add the necessary users who belong to each
				group.</para>
			<para>We can then turn it on the onCourse preferences under LDAP/Authorisation and Roles and
				set it up the same as the following picture:</para>
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"
						fileref="images/LDAP_AD_authorisation_settings.png" format="png" />

			<para>That is all for Windows Server AD/LDAP authentication and authorisation! good
				luck!</para>

		<title>Using an external database</title>
		<para>In order to connect to external databases such as MySQL and MS SQL, onCourse Server needs
			to know where the external database lives. This can be done by using a server configuration
			file, see <xref xlink:href="#serverconfigurationfile" /> below. Starting the server with
			special arguments (in the cases of headless configurations commonly found on Unix-derivative
			systems such as FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris), or choosing the external database option through
			GUI when first starting onCourse Server. <note>
				<para>connecting to an external database is a paid for feature, you must contact us to
					enable it. </para>
			</note></para>
		<para>A valid URI contains the following information: <simplelist>
				<member> host, e.g. 203.29.62.146 or delish.ish.com.au </member>
				<member> port, e.g. 1376, 3306 or 1521 </member>
				<member> database name, e.g. onCourse </member>
				<member> user name, e.g. oncourse </member>
				<member> password, e.g. oncourse </member>
				<member> every vendor has its own URI (URL) format which has to be used (remind quotations)
				</member>
			</simplelist> MS SQL Server:
			<programlisting>
				  db=jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://&lt;host>:&lt;port>/&lt;dbName>;user=username;password=password
				  db=jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://203.29.62.146:1376/onCourse;user=oncourse;password=oncourse
				</programlisting>
			MySQL:
			<programlisting>
				  db=jdbc:mysql://&lt;host>:&lt;port>/&lt;dbname>?user=username&amp;password=password
				  db=jdbc:mysql://delish.ish.com.au:3306/onCourse?user=oncourse&amp;password=oncourse
				</programlisting>
			It is not necessary to specify a port, if the default port is used. </para>

		<title>Server Memory Allocation</title>
		<para>In addition, you can specify a different memory utilisation for onCourse Server. onCourse
			Server will try to use all the memory you allocate to it, since it makes use of that memory
			for caching. Up to a certain point, adding more memory will help, but after that more memory
			will have no effect or even slow things down since the server has more work to do managing all
			that cache. You will have to tune your settings according to your own needs, but the default
			will do fairly well for most installations.</para>
		<para>If you are running Linux or Unix, you will find the necessary settings in the startup
			script. On Windows you need to create a text file with the name onCourseServer.vmoptions or
			onCourseService.vmoptions. The name of this file before the dot must match exactly the name of
			your executable before the dot. In that file put
			this:<programlisting>-Xmx1500M</programlisting></para>
		<para>That will increase the cache to 1500 Mb for onCourse Server. About another 80Mb will be
			used by the application itself, so the total usage will be those two combined. On Windows
			32bit, never go past 1.5Gb for onCourse because of limitations in Windows. A Unix or OSX 32bit
			environment will allow you to assign up 3.5Gb.</para>
		<para>The onCourseServer.log will report errors of java.lang.OutOfMemoryError if you have given
			the onCourse Server insufficient RAM for your usage requirements. Prior to this your end users
			may also detect processing errors, such as failing enrolments.</para>
		<para>Beyond what you have allocated to onCourse, make sure the server has sufficient RAM to run
			the operating system and other applications. It is very important that the server doesn't swap
			memory to disk at any time or you will encounter major performance problems.</para>
		<para>In a 64bit operating system you can install more than 4Gb of RAM in the server memory. OS
			X users will be running 64bit by default. We recommend installing 64bit operating systems for
			all servers.</para>
