        <para>Assessments assigned to the class inform the training and assessment plan for that
            class.</para>
        <para>On the Attendance tab of the class, you will see all sessions, outcomes, and scheduled
            assessments for a class.</para>
        <para>Assessments will be mixed with the scheduled sessions based on their date. Some
            assessments will have due dates during the class training period where other assessments
            will have due dates after the training period is complete.</para>
        <para>For each assessment task, you can indicate if a scheduled unit of competency will be
            assessed via that task by assigning the unit to the task.</para>
        <para>In this example, there is an assessment task due on 20 March (with an open related
            icon link). This assessment task has been linked to the first four units of competency
            listed in the class.</para>

        <para>The training plan set up in the class timetable can also be modified in this view. In
            the timetable view there is a tick / untick all units assigned to a session. This allows
            you to set up the training plan per column of this view.</para>
        <para>In this view, you can tick or untick all sessions assigned to the unit. Next to each
            unit code is a black triangle that appears when you hover over the name. Clicking here
            give you a drop down list to assign the unit to all sessions and tasks, or unassign the
            unit to all sessions and task. This allows you to bulk edit the training plan per
            row.</para>
        <para>Between the column and row edit options, you can quickly create your class training
            and assessment plan.</para>
