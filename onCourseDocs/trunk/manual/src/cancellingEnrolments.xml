		<title>Cancelling a single enrolment</title>
		<para>It is important to remember that within the accrual financial system of onCourse, that
			every action has an opposite. When an enrolment is created, an invoice is generated to the
			payer. When the payer pays the invoice, a payment in record is created. If you want to cancel
			an invoice or refund a payment, you need to generate an equal and opposite record. To reverse
			an invoice, you create a credit note (a negative invoice) and to give someone back their
			money, you need to create a payment out. This section outlines the common processes involved
			in creating credit notes and refunds.</para>
		<example>
			<title>How to cancel a single enrolment</title>
			<para>If you need to remove a student from a class, due to them withdrawing or failing to attend,
				you need to cancel their enrolment. If you wish to provide them with a credit note
				you can do this at the time of the enrolment cancellation. </para>
			<para>The first step is to cancel and credit the existing enrolment.</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Find the enrolment in the Enrolments window</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Highlight the enrolment by clicking on it</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Click on the cogwheel option in the top right hand corner and choose "Cancel 1
						enrolment". This will bring up a dialog with a checkbox offering to also
						credit the enrolment fee charged. If you keep this ticked, you will create a
						create note as part of this process. If you uncheck it, you will retain all
						the student's fees as part of your business income. 99% of the time you want
						to create a credit note. If the student's enrolment is unpaid, the credit
						note will pay their unpaid invoice, rather than leaving it as an unpaid debt
						on your books.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>In the cancellation window, choose if you want to send the student a
						credit note email. If you are have not previously agreed to transfer the
						student to another class, or provide them with a refund, selecting this
						option will let the student know how much credit they have available with
						you for future redemption.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Hit "Proceed".</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>This process will cancel the enrolment, and create a credit note in the system for the
				value of the existing enrolment. Note that the credit note will apply to the
				original payer of the invoice. This may not be the student who enrolled in the
				class, but their employer, parent or other third party. Read the text in the
				cancellation window to confirm if the student and the payer are the same or
				different people.</para>
			<para>If the invoice originally issued for this enrolment remains unpaid, the credit note created
				will create an automatic contra payment against that invoice, in effect 'cancelling'
				it from requiring payment.</para>
			<para>If the originating invoice was paid in full, the credit note can be used to contra
				pay another outstanding invoice from that debtor, if you choose. You can manually
				select this option from the invoice list window in the cog wheel options.</para>
		</example>
		<tip>
			<para>Please note that a payment back to the student will not be automatically created after
				cancelling an enrolment. That student might want use the credit to enrol into another class.
				Or you may wish to contact the student and arrange a refund. The next sections explain these
				options in detail.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Outcome deletion on cancellation</title>
			<para>While all enrolments in onCourse create outcomes, including those in non-VET
				programs, the outcomes that can cause concern for reporting are those associated
				with VET enrolments.</para>
		<para>During the enrolment cancellation a checkbox is ticked by default that says 'Delete outcomes
				linked to this enrolment with status "not set"'. If you have not given any outcomes
				a status yet, this will mean all the outcomes attached to the enrolment will be
				deleted. This will be desirable for most types of enrolments, where you do not want
				to report the student as having enrolled in this program at all for AVETMISS
				purposes.</para>
			<para>If the student needs to be reported as a withdrawn student for AVETMISS purposes,
				you have two options. Either set the value of the outcomes before the cancellation
				process, and they will be retained by default. Alternatively, you can untick the
				option 'Delete outcomes linked to this enrolment with status "not set"' so all
				outcomes, both set and not set, will be retained. To avoid AVETMISS errors, you will
				need to make sure that any unset outcomes that are retained are given a valid
				outcomes status, such as 60 - Withdrawn after processing the cancellation. </para>
			<para>Retained outcomes attached to cancelled enrolments are reported like all other
				outcomes. If you want to suppress them from all reporting, set the enrolment to 'Do
				not report for AVETMISS' on the enrolment general tab.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Changing a cancellation fee</title>
			
		<para>You can also elect to charge a cancellation fee (with or without tax) as per your college
				policies. The difference between the fee paid, and the cancellation fee charged will
				be available as credit to the student, or can be refunded to them. </para>
			<para>Note that if you charge GST, this amount will be added on to the value you specify e.g. in
				the screen shot below a $20 plus GST fee has been charged, totalling $22.</para>
			<para> You can select to have this administrative fee deposited into the income account of your
				choice. By default, the income account associated with the enrolment income line
				will be selected. Any GST component will be credited to the GST account.</para>

			<title>Cancelling an enrolment paid for by a voucher</title>
			<para>On occasion, you may have cause to cancel and enrolment that was originally paid for by an
				onCourse voucher. If this is the case, a warning will appear in the cancellation
				window to advise you that a credit note will be made for this student, just like for
				any other cancelled enrolment. There is no automatic 'crediting' of their original
				voucher.</para>
			<para>If you have a business rule that states that students who paid with vouchers can
				not access a refund, then use the credit note to purchase a new voucher for the
				student that they can again redeem.</para>
			<para>In the example below, the enrolment fee of $264 was paid for partially by a voucher ($200)
				and partially by cash ($64) - this can be found by looking at the original invoice
				for the enrolment.</para>
			<para>When the enrolment is cancelled and the credit note created, I could then purchase
				another $200 voucher for the student with the credit note, leaving them with $64 in
				general credit, that could either be used towards another enrolment or
				refunded.</para>

		<title>Creating a manual credit note</title>
		<para>On occasion, you may need to create a credit note of refund for a student without using the
			enrolment cancellation process. This may be because you wish to offer the student a
			credit to apply to further training (perhaps there was problem with the class they
			attended), because they purchased another product outside of the class enrolment, or
			because you created a credit note for the wrong amount during the enrolment
			cancellation.</para>
		<para>Before you can issue any type of refund, you must create a credit note. You can create a
			credit note manually in the invoice window. Note that this process is not necessary if
			you create a credit note during the enrolment cancellation process.</para>

			<title>A few notes on onCourse credit card reversals</title>
			<para>onCourse does not store credit card numbers. What it does store is a transaction
				reference number supplied by the bank. This transaction reference number allows you
				to reverse up to the original amount paid during the transaction. This means you can
				refund the payer with complete confidence that the payment is being returned to the
				original credit card that paid for the enrolment.</para>
			<para>There are some limitations that you need to be aware of however:</para>
			<para>1. Credit card transactions are only available to reverse up to three months after
				the initial date of purchase. An attempted refund to a transaction older than this
				will fail.</para>
			<para>2. You can only refund UP TO the original amount of the transaction. You can not
				refund the student more than they paid per transaction. For example, if two $100
				enrolments we paid for in separate credit card transactions by the same contact and
				both cancelled and eligible for a refund, you would need to process two payments out
				of $100 each, once against each transaction.</para>
			<para>3. If the credit card you are attempting to refund has been cancelled by it's
				owner, or expired, the attempt to refund it will fail. You will need to contact the
				student and arrange an alternate refund method.</para>

			<title>Reporting on cancelled classes</title>
			<para>Advertising classes, taking enrolments and payments and then having to cancelling the class
				due to insufficient enrolments or change or circumstance is a real cost to a
				training organisation.</para>
			<para>From a business perspective, rescheduling a class to a future date is far more advisable
				than cancelling a class, but sometimes a cancellation will still be necessary. As an
				organisation, should you wish to understand your cancellation rates and 'lost'
				potential income, a report called 'Cancelled classes count' is available from the
				class list of reports.</para>
			<para>Begin by selecting the core filter 'cancelled classes' to show only your cancelled classes
				in the list view. Then search or highlight the classes in the range you wish to
				report on. Once you have selected the classes, choose File > Print > Cancelled
				classes count, or use the share icon.</para>
			<para>This report will show you the enrolments that were in the class prior to the
				cancellation and the income that had been collected.</para>

		<title>Student Transfer Questions</title>
		<para>If you wish to transfer a student, first you need to cancel their existing enrolment,
			then enrol them into a new class.</para>
		<para>Student transfers need to be done one student at a time. Using the transfer wizard
			option outlined above will make this process fairly quick, ensuring the previous payer
			and class are pre-selected for you in Quick Enrol,</para>
		<section>
			<title>What if the value of the new enrolment is more expensive than the old class or
				less expensive?</title>
			<para> As onCourse tracks the amount owing for the student, no money is lost by the system by
				cancelling and refunding. If the student has been given credit from their previous
				enrolment for $100, but the class you are transferring them into costs $120 you can
				either:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem><para>Do nothing and Quick Enrol will request payment for the additional $20, which you can collect
						via all the usual payment methods available including credit card</para></listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Choose to manually discount the enrolment in Quick Enrol by $20, allowing
						their credit of $100 to cover to apply leaving the account with a balance of
						$0.</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>If their new enrolment is less expensive than their previous class, you can choose to keep
				their credit on file indefinitely to apply to a future enrolment, or provide them
				with a refund for the credit remaining once you have processed the new enrolment. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Why can't I just edit the existing enrolment? </title>
			<para> onCourse tracks enrolments and financial data in a way which leaves a complete
				audit trail. So at any time you will be able to see all the enrolment history for
				every student, including enrolments they have withdrawn from. This is very important
				for financial auditing and system security reasons which especially when several
				staff might be making changes or looking at the history in the system. </para>
			<para>Furthermore the refund/Quick Enrol process makes the work flow clearer when the new class
				has a different cost to the old. The operator is explicitly prompted to collect an
				additional payment or retain part of the credit note. By then applying an additional
				charge or discount, general ledger adjustments are kept accurate and clear. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>How can I fix a mistake I made where I charged the student the wrong amount or
				credited a credit note in error?</title>
			<para>Remember that the opposite of an invoice is a credit note. If the student owes you more
				than you originally charged them, create a manual invoice for the difference. If you
				charged them too much in error, create a manual credit note for the difference. If
				you want to check the balance of a student's account, go to the contact window and
				look at their finance tab. This will show all invoices, credit notes, payments in
				and payments out at the current balance of their account e.g. do they owe you money,
				do you owe them money, or is everything square? </para>
			<para>You can also use the contra pay feature to use the balance of a credit note to
				'pay off' an outstanding balance on an invoice. Select the credit note in the
				invoice window, and using the cog wheel option 'Contra Invoice..' locate the invoice
				you want to pay. This only works for credit notes/invoices for the same contact. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title> How can I use one contact's credit to pay for another student's enrolment? </title>
			<para> If the contact in credit wishes to use their credit towards another person's
				enrolment, follow the steps for <uri>3rd Party Payments</uri>, ensuring that you
				select the contact in credit as the payer. </para>
