	<title>Certification</title>
	<para>There are two types of Certification available within onCourse:</para>
	<orderedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>Vocational Education Training (VET) Certification, which creates a permanent
				record stored in the database for compliance purposes, and forms the basis of
				NAT00130 Program Completed data reported to NCVER that is used to create the
				student's official USI Transcript.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Certificates of Attendance for non accredited and professional development course
				certification. No formal register of this type of certificate creation is stored in
				onCourse, nor is their issuance reported to any formal bodies.</para>
		</listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	<para>This chapter of the user documentation covers the creation, customisation and distribution
		of both these types of certificates.</para>
	<section xml:id="rto-Certificates">
		<title>About onCourse Certificates</title>
		<para>onCourse includes the AQF recommended templates for full Qualification Certificates,
			Skill Set Statements of Attainment, Statements of Attainment and transcripts. These
			templates can be modified as needed to meet your own style guides and content
			preferences. Certificates can only be generated from units that are recorded as part of
			onCourse enrolments or Prior Learning records. If you wish to include prior learning or
			credit transfer units, you will need to add these outcomes to the student's record
			before you create the certificate.</para>
		<para>By generating the certificate record in onCourse you will have created the data
			required to meet the ASQA Standards for RTOs 2015 - Standard 3. The certificate list is
			your Certificate Register. A certificate record you create is available in the
			certificate table in onCourse for printing, AVETMISS export and re-printing. Once
			created, the certificate record can be edited and amended or even deleted prior to
			printing, but after the record is printed it becomes locked in the database to ensure an
			accurate record of your issued certificates are retained.</para>
		<para>The associate outcomes that make up the certificate also become locked in the
			database, so they can not have their outcome status changed, or be deleted after the
			certificate has been issued.</para>
		<para>Every certificate record created is issued a unique certificate number, which is
			printed on the certificate face. The same number series is used for Qualifications and
			Statements of Attainment. The records will begin at 1 and automatically increment each
			time a certificate is created.</para>
		<para>If you are required to generate and submit AVETMISS data, any certificate record you
			create that is marked as being for a full Qualification or skill set will create a
			corresponding record in the NAT00130 file. You can also go to File > Import/Export >
			Export Certificates to create a CSV file of your certificate register.</para>
		<para>There are several dates in an onCourse certificate record. They are awarded date,
			issued date, expiry date, printed on date and revoked on date. </para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Awarded:</emphasis> Awarded is the date the certificate record
			is generated in onCourse. It's an arbitrary date in that it can be edited up until the
			certificate has been printed, or a PDF generated.</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Issued:</emphasis> Issued is the date the certificate is issued
			to the student. It's an arbitrary date in that it can be edited up until the certificate
			has been printed, or a PDF generated.</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Expiry:</emphasis> Expiry dates are only used for timed
			certificates, like First Aid Certificates. This is the date that the certificate will
			expire.</para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Printed On:</emphasis> This is the date the certificate record was
			turned into a generated PDF and either distributed to the student digitally, or printed
			on to paper. </para>
		<para><emphasis role="bold">Revoked On:</emphasis> This is the date the certificate record
			was revoked by the system.</para>

			<section>
				<title>Automating the Certificate creation process</title>
				<para>There are two pieces of the VET certification process you can automate with
					default scripts. You can choose to enable one or both of these scripts depending
					on the business automation aspects you wish to use.</para>
				<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>The creation of the VET Statement of Attainment or Qualification in
							onCourse using the 'automatic creation of VET Certificates' script. This
							script looks at the units attached to the student's enrolments, and the
							Qualification properties of the course they have enrolled in. When all
							units from the enrolment have been assigned outcomes, the script creates
							either a Statement of Attainment or Qualification/Skill Set
							certification for the student in the onCourse Certificate table.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>The issuing of the VET Certificate to the student via upload to the
							portal using the 'send certificate vet created notification' script.
							This script determines if the certificate is eligible to be printed
							based on the student's USI status being verified, and then prints the
							certificate, attaches it to the enrolment record, uploads it to the
							portal and sends the student an email notice where they can click and
							retrieve their certificate without a password (for 7 days) or retrieve
							by entering a password past 7 days.</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Enabling the automatic VET Certificate creation script</title>
				<para>Like most included scripts, the 'automatic creation of VET Certificates'
					script is disabled by default. If you wish to automate this script you will need
					to enable it in the File > Preferences> Scripts menu.</para>
				<para>The script checks at 4am every day check for outcomes which have been modified
					in the previous 24 hrs. If any outcomes attached to the enrolment are not yet
					marked, the enrolment is skipped for certificate creation. When all outcomes
					have a status, then the certificate creation process is triggered. This means if
					outcomes are marked over time, the certificate will not be created until the
					last outcome of the enrolment is marked.</para>
				<para>It is important to note here that an outcome with an indeterminate status like
					a 70 or 90 will trigger the certificate creation process. There are almost no
					cases where you should enter this value in an onCourse record - allow the
					AVETMISS export runner to set these values as needed.</para>
				<para>For students with at least one successful outcome, create the certificate
					record (Statement of Attainment or Qualification, based on the 'Satisfies
					complete qualification or skill set' flag at the course level). If the outcome
					is already joined to a certificate, this script will not create a new
					certificate containing that outcome. </para>
				<para>You can identify these auto-created certificates in onCourse as the issued on
					date will be 'not set' until they are printed.</para>
				<qandaset>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para>What will happen if a student has enrolled in full Qualification
								but only successfully completed some of their units?</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>If all the outcomes have been given a value, and some of the
								outcomes are unsuccessful, then the student will be issued a
								Statement of Attainment, rather than a Qualification. The successful
								units will print on the certificate face, and on the accompanying
								transcript, both the successful and unsuccessful units will be
								printed.</para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para>What happens if a student is enrolled in a class with a single
								outcome and it is marked as unsuccessful, but then they resubmit and
								assessment and the outcome becomes successful?</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>They will not be issued a certificate in the first instance,
								because they were unsuccessful, however when the outcome is changed
								to success, it will trigger the certificate to be created</para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para>If a student has three outcomes attached to their enrolment are
								two are marked as successful and one is not marked, will they get a
								Statement of Attainment for the two successful outcomes?</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>No, the automated certificate creation process won't be triggered
								until the final outcome is marked. You can choose to make them a
								Statement of Attainment for the first two units manually, and when
								the third outcome is marked, they will get a second Statement of
								Attainment containing only that unit. If you do nothing, they will
								get a single statement containing all three units when the final
								outcome status is provided.</para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para>If a Statement of Attainment is created automatically for a
								student who partially succeed in completing a qualification, but I
								don't want to issue it, what should I do?</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>Before the Certificate is printed, you can delete it, or if it has
								been printed, revoke it.</para>

				<title>Manually creating certificates in bulk</title>
				<para>If you wish to create certificate records for the whole class group, we
					recommend creating the certificate records from the class cog wheel option. If
					at the course level, you checked the option 'Satisfies complete qualification or
					skill set' on the VET tab, enrolled students will be automatically generated
					either the qualification or skill set certificate for which the course is for.
					If you have not selected this option, Statements of Attainment will be
					generated. This option only selects outcomes from the student's record that have
					been created due to their enrolment in this particular class.</para>
				<para>Additional validation rules apply to this creation process to ensure that only
					student's who have achieved the outcome of the course are issued with the
					correct certification. For example, where a course is marked 'Satisfies complete
					qualification or skill set' on the VET tab, and the student has one or more unit
					with a non-successful outcome, a Statement of Attainment will be generated
					instead of a Qualification or skill set certificate. Where no outcomes have been
					marked as successful, no Statement of Attainment will be created.</para>
				<para>If you wish to create a certificate based on a single, or group of student's
					enrolments, then you can do the same thing from the enrolment window, by
					highlighting an enrolment or group of enrolments and using the cog wheel
					function to create the certificate records. Like the example above, this option
					only picks up outcomes attached to the particular enrolments you have selected
					(manual outcomes can be added to enrolments prior to certificate creation if
					needed)</para>

			<title>Step 2 - Verifying the Certificate</title>
			<section>
				<title>Manual verification prior to printing</title>
				<para>Certificate records in onCourse can either be full Qualifications, Statements
					of Attainment working towards a Qualification, Statements of Attainment with no
					qualification reference, or a Statement of Attainment for a skill set.</para>
				<para>If you have created the certificate from the course or enrolment cogwheel
					process, onCourse will select the most appropriate certificate type based on the
					course settings and the student's outcomes. For example, if a student enrolled
					in a complete qualification has one or more outcomes not set, a Statement of
					Attainment, rather than a Qualification will be created for them. You may need
					to add the missing outcome status and then change the certificate type to
					'qualification or skill set' prior to printing.</para>
				<para>You should confirm the certificate record that was created automatically is of
					the correct type prior to printing as this can not be changed afterwards.</para>
				<para>It is worth noting, that as with the course set up process, onCourse does not
					contain any reference data to determine if a full Qualification is valid or not.
					It is up to you as the certifying RTO to ensure when you create and issue a
					certificate record you have deemed a qualification, the student has achieved
					sufficient outcomes those outcomes are attached to the certificate
					record.</para>
				<para>You can also choose to attach unsuccessful outcomes to the certificate record,
					for example, outcomes where the student has withdrawn or been deemed not yet
					competent. These outcomes will print on the accompanying transcript that is
					generated when you print a certificate, but will not print on the Statement of
					Attainment certificate face. Only successful outcomes will print on the
					certificate face. </para>
				<para>If you wish to alter the Awarded on date from the default date the record was
					created, or the Issued on date from the default date the certificate was
					printed, you should do this prior to printing. These fields can be changed after
					printing if you notice the dates are incorrect, and the certificate
					reprinted.</para>
				<para>Add any public notes that you wish to display on the certificate face, such as
					information about the funded program that this certificate was delivered under,
					or the language the training was delivered in if not English, need to be
					manually added during the pre-printing verification process. There is no
					automatic population of this data from any where in onCourse. You can add
					information to this field, and the private notes field, after printing if you
					require, and reprint the certificate.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Certificate record verification during printing</title>
				<para>When you attempt to print a certificate created in onCourse, the following
					verification checks will take place. If the certificate is not valid, you will
					not be able to print it until you have corrected the data.</para>
				<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>You can attach any outcome from a students transcript to the
							certificate record, but if you attach an outcome where the status has
							not yet been set you will not be able to print the certificate record.
							Update the outcome status in the student's record first, then attempt to
							print again.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>If a certificate record contains all unsuccessful outcomes e.g. 40
							withdrawn, it can not be printed. You may choose to delete this type of
							certificate record.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>As of 1 January 2015, it is mandatory for all student's being issued a
							VET certification to have a verified USI on record. During print
							attempts, a check is conducted against the student record and the print
							process may not be allowed. If the student doesn't have a USI or doesn't
							have a verified USI, an access control option can allow you override
							this restriction and print the certificate. More information is
							available in the <link xlink:href="usi.html">USI chapter</link></para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Revoking Certificates</title>
				<para>On occasion a printed certificate will contain an error, like a misspelled
					name.</para>
				<para>After printing a certificate, if you determine the certificate was printed in
					error, you can chose to revoke the certificate using the cogwheel option. This
					maintains the certificate reference in the database, with a note as to why you
					have revoked it. </para>
				<para>A revoked certificate can not be printed, but other valid certificates can be
					reprinted at any time. The last date you printed the certificate is
					automatically recorded in the certificate record.</para>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Step 3 - Printing Certificates</title>
			<para>To print a single certificate, go to the Certificates list view then hit the share
				button. Select the type of certificate you'd like to print and the background you'd
				like to use, then hit Print. A PDF version of the certificate will appear for you to
				print off for a student, or attach to an email to send to them.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Customising the layout of your VET Certificate template</title>
				<para>The certificate templates in onCourse contain the information about the
					certificate that is stored in the onCourse database, like the student name,
					qualification name and code and unit names and codes.</para>
				<para>Your RTO contact and registration details, logos, other required certificate
					logos and any other fixed visual elements in a printed certificate template
					should be in your background document. </para>
				<para>When you print a certificate record from onCourse, the onCourse certificate
					record information is overlaid on your background document to create a AQF
					compliant certificate. You can store multiple report background types in
					onCourse to use during printing.</para>
				<section>
					<title>Certificate Backgrounds</title>
					<para>The standard Qualification report includes a second report, the
						transcript, as the second page while a Statement of Attainment is only a
						single page report.</para>
					<para>If you already have a certificate background you have had professionally
						designed, which you order from the printers, you can choose to embed this
						background in the report. You should request a A4 PDF of your backgrounds
						from your designers first.</para>
					<para>If you do not have a professionally designed background, you can easily
						create your own using a simple word processing tool. Keep in mind the ASQA
						guidelines for issuing certificates and the appropriate use of the formal
						logos, when designing your backgrounds.</para>
					<para>You will also need a second page PDF background for the transcript
						report.</para>
					<para>If you create and upload a two page PDF, comprised of your Qualification
						background design followed by your letterhead or transcript design, for
						example, these pages will be used correctly when printing the combined
						report from onCourse. If the transcript is more than one page long, the
						second page of the template will be used for the subsequent pages
						printed.</para>
					<para>If you are printing Qualifications in bulk, onCourse will recognise when
						the student record has changed to the next student and therefore apply the
						first page of the PDF background again as this is a new Qualification. </para>
					<para>When creating a background for a Statement of Attainment report, only a
						single page background is required. On occasion, Statements of Attainment
						may contain reference to more units that can fit during printing on a single
						page. In this instance, the report will be split into multiple certificate
						pages. Each certificate number will be appended with a page number on
						printing e.g. certificate 472 may display as 472/1 and 472/2 if multiple
						pages are created.</para>
					<para>If you are manually printing a range of Statements of Attainment and
						Qualifications to the printer at a time, and you have different backgrounds
						for these reports, you need to print them in two groups - once group the
						Qualifications with their background chosen, the next group the Statement of
						Attainments with their background chosen. If you use the onCourse automated
						script to run the print and issue process, the correct background will be
						selected automatically.</para>
					<para>There is more information about how you can create and update report
						backgrounds in the <link xlink:href="reports-printing">reports
							chapter</link> of the documentation.</para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Certificate signatory name and title</title>
					<para>You can update the signatory name for your Certificate reports via the
						AVETMISS tab / General Preferences settings of onCourse. Remember that this
						field will appear as one line on your Certificate report, so you would add
						the name and title of the nominated signatory name in the one line. Go to
							<guimenuitem> File - Preferences - General Preferences</guimenuitem>and
						click on the AVETMISS tab, the 'Full certificate signatory name' field you
						need to edit is under 'Optional' on this tab. Whatever content you add to
						this field, will appear automatically within your Certificate Reports,
						unless your custom report has this information hard coded into it.</para>
					<para>If you require a different layout for the signatory fields i.e. two names,
						name and title on separate lines or embedded digital signature, we recommend
						you put all this data in the background and remove the signatory details
						from the onCourse report templates.</para>

					<title>Changes to the report templates</title>
					<para>Within the onCourse user interface, you can make some simple
						customisations of your certificate template wording. More detailed
						customisations require you to edit the report outside of onCourse.</para>
					<para>If you wish to make other changes to the fixed wording, the font sizes or
						styles or embed any other images into the certificate templates, then you
						will need to modify the report files outside of onCourse. You can do this
						yourself or you can request a quote from ish to do this for you if you are

					<para>This service allows employers or other RTOs to verify the issuing data

						<listitem>
							<para>If you are creating the Certificate directly from the class or the

					<title>Skills Set Statement of Attainment Certificate</title>
					<para>A skill set is a relatively new concept of a fixed grouping of units of
						competency to meet an industry need, that are less units than completing a
						whole qualification. Skill sets are defined by Training Packages and
						available on training.gov.au, and their names and codes are automatically
						downloaded into onCourse, along with units of competency and qualifications.
						You could think of a skill set as a mini qualification. In onCourse, they
						are treated similarly to a qualification, as in a student has to be
						competent in all of the skill set outcomes to be issued a complete skill
						set.</para>
					<para>Like a qualification, completed skill sets are reported in the AVETMIS
						NAT00130 file. Normal Statements of Attainment are not reported.</para>
					<para>If the course has been defined as being a 'complete qualification or skill
						set', and the student has successfully completed all the units of
						competency, then onCourse will attempt to create a skill set certificate for
						the participant.</para>
					<para>If you are manually creating a skill set certificate, you need to select
						the option inside the certificate window 'qualification or skill set' rather
						than Statement of Attainment, even though a skill set is a type of
						statement.</para>
					<para>On training.gov.au, each skill set includes suggested words for the
						Statement of Attainment. If you wish to add these words to your printed
						certificate, be sure to copy and paste them into the Certificate public
						(printed) notes fields.</para>

				<title>Scripted Certificate Distribution</title>
				<para>A default onCourse script called 'send certificate vet created notification'

				<para>By default, this script runs at 5am each day and prints all unprinted
					certificates in the database, where the student has a verified USI.</para>

					the printing of the certificate reports with the following backgrounds:</para>
				<orderedlist>
					<listitem>

				<para>This script sends the email template 'certificate available' which you should
					adjust as needed before enabling the script. Keep in mind this email template is
					also used by the script to send non-VET certificates, 'send certificate created
					notification', so if you adjust it, and use both scripts, then the wording needs
					to make sense for both VET and non-VET courses. Alternatively, you could make a
					copy of this template, and use two different versions, one for each

				<para>By default, the link in the email template is to
						<code>${enrolment.student.getPortalLink(enrolment)}</code>, which takes the
					student to their class page and presents them with the survey. If you do not
					wish to use this feature, you can instead replace the link in the template with
						<code>${enrolment.student.getPortalLink(certificate)}</code> to direct the
					student directly to their certificate. You will also want to adjust the wording
					of the template depending on which link you use. Be sure to make your changes to
					both the plain text and HTML versions of the email.</para>
				<para>You can test your emails by ensuring an enrolled student has your email
					address in their contact record and using the send email from template function
					in the enrolment window cogwheel.</para>
