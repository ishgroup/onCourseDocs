		<para>When you create a class, you bring together all the different elements of data that
			you have already entered into onCourse. Information relating to tutors, courses, sites
			and rooms etc. gets linked through the classes screen to create the event that is your
			class. </para>
		<para>For example when you assign a tutor to a class through the class screen, this
			information is also duplicated on the tutor's contact screen. So when you look at that
			tutor's screen you will see what class, which location and when the tutor is scheduled
			to teach.</para>
		<para>Once you have created a class, if you wish to offer the same program again, but
			starting on a different date, it is a simple process to duplicate the class. This allows
			all the information you have already set up to be copied into a new class, but moves the
			sessions forward to your new start date. You can also manage class duplications in bulk,
			copying all your classes from one semester to the next. </para>
		<tip>
			<para>Many colleges develop special codes to assist in identifying classes in groups like
				categories or regions to make them easier to remember and search on. A simple method
				is to number or alphabetise the classes. For example if your course is Dancing For
				Beginners and the course code is DFB, you may wish to create the class code for the
				first class of this course as "01". This will then allow future classes in this same
				course to be listed in order ie. 01, 02, 03. When you duplicate the class the final
				number will automatically increment. </para>

			These will assist you in monitoring if students are meeting the course attendance
			requirements. </para>
		<para>You can also mark attendance as Absent with reason and Partial attendance by right
			clicking on the attendance icon. For both of these attendance types you also need to
			record a note against the student's record as to why they are absent, and for partial
			attendance you need to record the time that was attended so the percentage attendance
			calculation can be recorded. Absent with reason will still be taken into account as an
			absence for the purposes of determining percentage attendance. </para>
		<para>When you run a tutor's payslip, you will have the option to count all scheduled
			sessions towards their payment, or only those you have marked as attended or partially
			attended. </para>
