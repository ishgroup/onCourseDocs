				<para>
					<emphasis role="bold">Parts of the window</emphasis> -On the right hand part of the window
					are the class records listed in a summary view. The title bar shows you how many records
					you have. The top section of the window contains the search function and the add and
					delete records button. You will also find a cog wheel button that allows for special
					functions for one or more records in the list. In the left hand side of the list window
					are quick searches to enable you to work with groups of data. </para>

		<para>When you create a class, you bring together all the different elements of data that you
			have already entered into onCourse. Information relating to tutors, courses, sites and rooms
			etc. gets linked through the classes screen to create the event that is your class. That means
			once you have entered the relevant information on the different tabs in the classes screen,
			then the students, the class, the course, the tutor and the sessions all become connected
			through out your onCourse program. The relationship between these different pieces of
			information becomes linked in onCourse and allows you to access your required information
			through a variety of different screens. </para>
		<para>For example when you assign a tutor to a class through the class screen, this information
			is also duplicated on the tutor's contact screen. So when you look at that tutor's screen you
			will see what class, which location and when the tutor is scheduled to teach.</para>
		<para>Once you have created a class, if you wish to offer the same program again, but starting
			on a different date, it is a simple process to duplicate the class. This allows all the
			information you have already set up to be copied into a new class, but moves the sessions
			forward to your new start date. You can also manage class duplications in bulk, copying all
			your classes from one semester to the next. </para>
		<tip>
			<para>Many colleges develop special codes to assist in identifying classes in groups like
				categories or regions to make them easier to remember and search on. A simple method is to
				number or alphabetise the classes. For example if your course is Dancing For Beginners and
				the course code is DFB, you may wish to create the class code for the first class of this
				course as “01” or “A”. This will then allow future classes in this same course to be listed
				in order ie. 01, 02 or A, B, C etc. When you duplicate the class the number or letter will
				automatically increment. </para>

				<listitem>
					<para>Create minimum and maximum enrolments for your class. The minimum amount of
						enrolments is usually determined by the college as the least number of students needed
						to make the class financially or educationally viable. The maximum is often the capacity
						of the venue. This is the minimum amount of data needed to create a class. Projected
						enrolments are optional, but can be used to calculate your projected income for the
						class. Projected enrolments are usually a number between the minimum and maximum - how

		<title>Publishing classes online</title>
		<para> If you have published the course online, you can then publish the classes online for
			students to enrol in. All classes published are considered open for enrolment. You can not
			prevent students from enrolling in a class once it has been published online, so it is
			advisable to ensure all the advertising details are correct prior to publishing. </para>
		<para>The marketing information for most of your programs will be located in the course web tab.
			Only where there is information particular to this instance of the class would you need to add
			information to the class web tab. For example, if each instance of the class required students
			to bring different materials because they worked on new projects each term, would you publish
			this information in the class tab. </para>
		<para>Classes can be published online by selecting the option on the general tab 'enrolment
			allowed and visible online'. You can also add or remove classes to the website in bulk using
			the cogwheel function in the classes list view. </para>
		<para>Only current and future classes will show online. Classes with no start or end date set
			will not be published, and classes that are complete i.e. the end date has passed, will be
			automatically removed from your onCourse website. onCourse does not prevent students from
			enrolling once the class is commenced, but commenced classes are clearly marked on the
			website. </para>
		<para>The minimum and maximum places you set in the class are also used on your onCourse website
			to show students if there are places still available. The website will not show students the
			maximum number of places, or how many students have already enrolled. This is what the website
			will display: </para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para> if the class is full: it will read ‘class full' </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para> If the class has been cancelled it will read 'Cancelled'. If you have published class
					information in a hard copy brochure, we recommend leaving cancelled classes on the website
					so perspective students can see that the class they are looking for is not available.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para> if there are six or more places available, it will read ‘places available' </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para> if there are between one and five places available, it will give a count of the
					places available, for example it may read ‘3 places available'. </para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>Providing an enrolment count when their are less than five places available creates a
			sense of urgency: The student knows there are only a few places available, so they will
			hopefully be motivated to enrol as soon as possible, so they don't miss out on joining the
			class. </para>

		<title>Creating class budgets</title>
		<para>The budget feature is enabled with some paid onCourse support contracts. Check your
			college's support agreement to see if this feature has been enabled for your organisation. </para>
		<para>Class budgets allow users to add additional income, expense and wages lines to assist your
			program coordinators to determine the profitability of a class. In addition to the
			income collected from your current enrolments, you can predict the income and expenses
			you will incur for any projected number of enrolments. </para>
		<para>This function can be particularly useful for long term income planning. For example, if
			you are in a position to schedule your classes a year in advance, you can predict the income
			for each class based on the class budget. Throughout the year you can compare your actuals to
			your predicted income and see how you are tracking against the budget. </para>

		<title>Adding RTO and VET data to class records</title>
		<para>To assist you in reporting accurate AVETMISS data, some information can be set and collected

						hours. Where you have provided them, your reportable hours will default to the nominal

			Here you will see the course-class code, the course name, the status of the student and the
			source, whether or not a discount has been applied and the price of the class before the
			discount. There is also an invoice hyperlink. Click on this and the invoice for the student
			and this class will open. This is also accessible through the invoice screen. </para>
		<para>Keep in mind that the invoice for a particular student may not be in the enrolled

		<title>Marking Student and Tutor attendance</title>
		<para>Attendance tracking is both useful for calculating tutor wages and also to determine the
			overall attendance percentage for a student. This is particularly relevant if you are required
			to meet CRICOS overseas student attendance requirements. </para>
		<para>For every session you create for a class, a corresponding attendance record will be
			created. Each session can be marked as Unmarked, Attended or Absent without reason by simply
			clicking on the icon for the student for the session. </para>
		<para>Alternatively, you can mark all students for a session or all sessions for a student by
			clicking on triangle next to the date or student's name and choosing one of the options. </para>
		<para>As you begin to mark attendance for a student, a percentage attended will be calculated
			and displayed. When attendance reaches 80% or less a yellow notice icon will be displayed.
			When attendance reaches 70% or less a red warning icon will be displayed. These will assist
			you in monitoring if students are meeting the course attendance requirements. </para>
		<para>You can also mark attendance as Absent with reason and Partial attendance by right
			clicking on the attendance icon. For both of these attendance types you also need to record a
			note against the student's record as to why they are absent, and for partial attendance you
			need to record the time that was attended so the percentage attendance calculation can be
			recorded. Absent with reason will still be taken into account as an absence for the purposes
			of determining percentage attendance. </para>
		<para>When you run a tutor's payslip, you will have the option to count all scheduled sessions
			towards their payment, or only those you have marked as attended or partially attended.
