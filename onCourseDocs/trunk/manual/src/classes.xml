			<para>If you show you tutors in your onCourse website, this also allows their associated

			<para>Tutor roles are defined in the onCourse preferences > Tutor roles. This is where

			<para>If the parent course of your class is linked to multiple units of competency you
				can use the class timetable to create a training plan. By default, all outcomes will

		<para>When you create a class, you bring together all the different elements of data that

		<para>For example when you assign a tutor to a class through the class screen, this

		<para>Once you have created a class, if you wish to offer the same program again, but

			<para>Many colleges develop special codes to assist in identifying classes in groups

				Dancing For Beginners and the course code is DFB, you may wish to create the class
				code for the first class of this course as "01". This will then allow future classes
				in this same course to be listed in order i.e.. 01, 02, 03. When you duplicate the

			<title>How to create sessions</title>
			<para>The following is a detailed example of how you would add sessions for a class on different
				days of the week. This example will use the scenario of a user wanting to add 10
				sessions on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays. </para>
			<para>The idea here is to create the first session for each different day of the week
				the sessions are being held on, and then we'll duplicate those sessions. So first
				we'll create the first Saturday session, then we'll create the first Sunday session.
				Then, we'll duplicate those sessions four more times each so that they take place
				each subsequent week from the first session, making it a 10 session class. Here's
				how:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>On the timetable section, hit the + button to create a new session.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>First enter the start date and time, then the session's duration in hours. You can also
						edit the payable duration, which ties to your tutor pay settings allowing
						you to exclude times for breaks etc. If you've assigned tutors to the class,
						you'll be able to leave a check mark next to the tutors who will be assigned
						to this session. Lastly, you can set the location from a list of your Sites
						and Rooms.</para>
					<para>Below is an example of how your first class will look once filled out. This one starts on
						the Saturday 21st March at 10am. The class goes for 4 hours though the
						lecturer is paid for 3 hours and 30 minutes because of a 30 minute break.
						The tutor for this session is Ivan Brown and he's being paid at the General
						Tutor pay rate. The session will take place at Sydney Campus in the Training
						Lab.</para>

			for study, or you can add an individual commitment ID or other various AVETMISS details
			that relate only to this enrolment. You can also review any associated Invoices or
			Outcomes, RPL credits, attach documents or set any notes.</para>
		<para>Only student's marked as Active are currently enrolled in the class and are counted
			towards the class numbers. Students marked as credited or cancelled have been removed
			from the class list, but their name still appears here for historical record keeping
			purposes. </para>
		<para>Keep in mind that the invoice for a particular student may not be in the enrolled
			student's name. For example, if a company pays for a team of their staff to attend a
			class, the invoice will be to the company. </para>
		<para>There are also fields particular to RTOs who submit AVETMISS data. These include Study
			reason, Fee exemption/concession type, Client identifier: Apprenticeships, Training
			contract: Apprenticeships and Full time flag (QLD only). You can set this information
			for each student as it applies to them. </para>
		<para>In addition to the enrolment records, the class window now contains a list of outcomes
			for each student enrolled. See the RTO Guide for more information about setting and
			modifying outcomes. </para>

		<title>Marking Student and Tutor attendance</title>
		<para>Attendance tracking is both useful for calculating tutor wages and also to determine
			the overall attendance percentage for a student. This is particularly relevant if you
			are required to meet CRICOS overseas student attendance requirements. </para>
		<para>Attendance can be marked inside the onCourse class record, or via the online portal by
			the class tutor.</para>
		<para>For every session you create for a class, a corresponding attendance record will be
			created. Each session can be marked as Unmarked, Attended or Absent without reason by
			simply clicking on the icon for the student for the session. </para>
		<para>Alternatively, you can mark all students for a session or all sessions for a student
			by clicking on triangle next to the date or student's name and choosing one of the
			options. </para>
		<para>As you begin to mark attendance for a student, a percentage attended will be
			calculated and displayed. When attendance reaches 80% or less a yellow notice icon will
			be displayed. When attendance reaches 70% or less a red warning icon will be displayed.
			These will assist you in monitoring if students are meeting the course attendance
			requirements. </para>
		<para>You can also mark attendance as Absent with reason and Partial attendance by right
			clicking on the attendance icon. For both of these attendance types you also need to
			record a note against the student's record as to why they are absent, and for partial
			attendance you need to record the time that was attended so the percentage attendance
			calculation can be recorded. Absent with reason will still be taken into account as an
			absence for the purposes of determining percentage attendance. </para>
		<para>When you run a tutor's payslip, you will have the option to count all scheduled
			sessions towards their payment, or only those you have marked as attended or partially
			attended. </para>
		<para>A 'Class Attendance' CSV export is available from the class window to export all the
			session attendance, notes and dates of who marked the session into a format you can open
			in Excel.</para>
		<para>A printed report available from the contact window 'Student Attendance Averages' will
			calculate the student attendance percentage for each month of the last twelve months.
			Ongoing student attendance percentage data is also available in the student and tutor
			portals.</para>
