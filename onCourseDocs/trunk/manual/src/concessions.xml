		<title>What is a concession?</title>
		<para>A concession is a way of categorising a student into a group which may be eligible for
			a discount. Concessions may be externally defined groups, like High School Students,
			Senior's or Health Care Card Holders. You may ask these students to provide details of
			their membership to a group by providing a card number and expiry date. You may allow
			students to add these details to their record on the website during enrolment or via
			their profile. Concessions can also be internally defined groups like teaching staff,
			admin staff and VIP students. These types of concessions may not have numbers or expiry
			dates, and can not be added by students on the website, but can still be used to provide
			discounts when enrolling online.</para>
		<para>Concessions, discounts, memberships and promotional codes are a powerful part of
			onCourse marketing. For more information on how to apply concessions or memberships to a
			discount, see <link xlink:href="discounts.html">the discount chapter</link>

		<section xml:id="concessions-whatIsAMembership">
		<title>What is a membership?</title>
		<para>Memberships are products which can be purchased. Being a member may entitle a student
			to discounts, and possibly also provide that discount to their related contacts. For
			example, you may sell a membership to a company that provides a discount to all of their
			staff. Memberships are valid for a fixed period of time e.g. twelve months from
			purchase, and any discounts associated with the membership will not be available after
			expiry. Memberships may also be sold for no cost, for example for members of an external
			program, or may be sold but have no discount associated with membership, for example
			annual financial members of a community organisation who have AGM voting rights.</para>

			<title>Adding a concession to a student record</title>
			<para>Admin staff can add a concession record to a student's record at any time, either
				during the enrolment process or by editing their contact record.</para>
			<para>To add a concession, go to the general tab of the student record. Click on the +
				above the concession panel to add the concession of your choice. The concession type
				must have already been defined as per the process described above.</para>
			<para>Depending on the settings of the concession type, the number and expiry date
				fields may be mandatory to complete. You can add multiple concessions to a student
				record using this process.</para>
			<para>If you add the concession to the student's record during the Quick Enrol process,
				any applicable discount will be applied immediately.</para>

		<title>Creating a membership</title>
		<para>Memberships can be created from the Resources > Memberships. A membership needs a name
			and should have a description so potential purchasers understand the benefits of the
			membership.</para>
		<para>A membership may have a fee to purchase, or could be given away for free. The
			membership will have a duration of either a set number of days from purchase, the
			beginning of the calendar or financial year or be for life.</para>

		<para>You can choose to make the membership available for purchase online, or only via
			internal purchase,</para>
		<para>At this point, you may choose to link to existing discount policies, or you may prefer
			to define the discounts that apply to people who hold this membership type later.</para>
		<para>An important distinction of membership discounts is that they can also apply across
			relationships. For example, a company could purchase a membership and the discount
			policy for that membership may apply to all staff of that company who enrol.</para>

		<title>Purchasing a membership</title>
		<para>A membership can be purchased from Quick Enrol, either in conjunction with an
			enrolment or as a standalone purchase.</para>
		<para>If the membership is purchased in conjunction with an enrolment that is eligible for a
			discount for members, then the discount will be applied at the time of purchase.</para>
		<para>Memberships can be purchased by either searching for a membership number or name in
			the 'Enter course or item' field. Alternatively you can click on the 'Show all' button
			next to the text 'MEMBERSHIPS' on the right hand side of the Quick Enrol window; this
