	<title>Creating and Modifying Contacts</title>
	<para>This chapter looks at the Contacts window in onCourse; how to understand the data in a
		contact record, create a new contact and the various types of data that flow from and
		through these types of records. These records are broken up into various sections, which
		when viewing the records edit view, will be displayed in the column on the right of the
		window - there's a good example of this in the second screenshot on this page. Click any of
		these heading to be taken directly to that section of the page.</para>

		<title> onCourse contact types</title>
		<para>A contact is any person or organisation your business works with in relation to
			running classes. There are three categories of contact in onCourse:</para>

				<para>Student - a person who has or intends on enrolling in your programs. You may

					outcomes and payments.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Tutor - these are the people that facilitate your classes, supervise
					assessments or assist your instructors. You may want to enter their resume or
					bio details to display on your website. You want to know what classes they have
					been scheduled to deliver and what payments you have made to them. A tutor can
					also be a student. If a tutor has an employed end date in the past and is no
					longer active, then they will be greyed out in the contact list view.</para>
			</listitem>

				<para>Company - a business that you may need to invoice, who may book their staff
					into your classes, or you may work with in partnership to deliver classes.
					Tutors can also be companies.</para>

		<section xml:id="contacts-VET">
			<title>Adding VET data to students</title>
			<para>Contacts who are marked as students have a section labelled VET. In this section,
				you can record the answers to the standard AVETMISS student questions regarding
				their country of birth, prior educational achievement and other required detail. For
				customers using an onCourse website to take enrolments, these questions are asked of
				the student at the time of enrolment. Only valid answers can be entered into these
				fields, with most fields referencing look up data such as the ABS list of countries
				and languages, or the approved list of AVETMISS responses.</para>
			<para>For Victorian and Queensland customers, the field to record the student number is
				also located in the VET section.</para>
			<para>For CRICOS providers, additional fields are available to record the students
				passport, visa and health care details. This information is not reported as part of
				the AVETMISS standard.</para>
			<para>Additional information, like the CRICOS student's next of kin, emergency contact
				or home-stay provider can be captured using the contacts relationships
				feature.</para>
			<para>If your students decline to provide information for one or more of these fields,
				we will automatically export the approved 'did not respond' code for that question,
				and also ensure that validation errors, like students speaking English as their
				first language and reporting themselves as speaking it well, are not exported from
				onCourse to cause problems with your funding providers.</para>
			<para>Please note that some student related AVETMISS questions are also located in their
				enrolment record, where the response is particular to that enrolment event e.g.
				their traineeship approval number or reason for study response.</para>

			<title>Student's enrolment and VET history</title>
			<para>The history of a students enrolments, outcomes and certifications is available in
				the contact Education tab.</para>
			<para>The first list component shows all the classes the student has been enrolled in.
				Some of these classes may have finished, so the enrolment status will show as
				'complete'. Classes which haven't started or are in progress show the status of
				'active'. If you click on the '+' symbol at the top right side of this list then
				this will pre-populate Quick Enrol with the students contact data.</para>
			<para>When a student's enrolment has been cancelled and/or credited, the enrolment
				status will show cancelled or credited. </para>
			<para>A complete enrolment history is retained for each student, including classes they
				have withdrawn from, so you will always have a full picture of their engagement with
				your college. Enrolments can not be deleted, but they can be cancelled, a credit
				note created, and that credit applied towards a new enrolment.</para>
			<para>The second list component shows a list of any prior learnings. </para>
			<para>The third list component shows the outcomes for all the units linked to all the
				student's enrolments. For non-VET enrolments, these will include non-assessable
				outcomes for their enrolments. You do not need to set anything for these enrolments,
				even if reporting them via AVETMISS, as an outcomes status of 81 is always exported
				for unset statuses in these types of outcomes. </para>
			<para>VET outcomes will show the national code and unit details and you can double click
				on this outcome to make changes or update the status.</para>
			<note>
				<para>When an enrolment is cancelled, the outcomes linked to the enrolment are
					deleted, except if you have already assigned them a status or used them to
					create a certificate. These outcomes will be retained on the student's
					file</para>
			</note>
			<para>The final list component of the enrolment record shows all the certificates (both
				Statements of Attainment and Qualifications) issued to the student. Unprinted
				certificates can be edited by double clicking on them, printed certificates can be
				revoked, but not edited. You can print certificates from the certificate table
				only.</para>

			<title>Contact's financial records</title>
			<para>When a contact is invoiced, or makes a payment, an entry is made in the contact's
				financial records. This is visible on the contact Financial tab. </para>
			<para>Often, a student is invoiced and pays for their own enrolment. When this occurs,
				you will see the financial data on the student's Financial tab. When the enrolment
				is paid for by another person (often termed a 3rd party payment) the financial data
				will be on the payer's Financial tab, and not the student's.</para>
			<para>All the financial transactions are shown in creation date order, with a running
				total that shows the contacts balance at any point in time. Invoices, credit notes,
				payments in and payments out, will all show on the Financial tab.</para>
			<para>You will also note from the following example that each payment line of the
				financial tab will identify if it was an incoming or outgoing payment. E.g. 'Credit
				card payment in (office)' reflects a payment in.</para>
			<para>On the financial tab you also have the ability to set some financial defaults that
				define settings when the conact is invoiced.</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Invoice terms days:</emphasis> This will be show the system
				default as defined in your financial preferences, but can be unlocked and set to a
				value specific to this contact. For example, your default may be 7 days but some
				contacts may have 30 day custom terms.</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">Tax (override): </emphasis>By default, all contacts will be
				charged the tax rate set for the product or class. However, some contacts may reside
				overseas and may not be liabile to pay local taxes like GST. In this case, you can
				choose to override to N for no GST to be applied to any invoice line created for an
				invoice joined to this contact. Not this does not affect invoices created in the
				past - only invoices created after this setting is applied.</para>

			<para>Special needs information can also be added to the student contact record on the

	<section xml:id="contacts-AdvancedSearch">
		<title>Finding contacts</title>
		<para>There are multiple ways you can search for contacts in the onCourse database. The
			simplest method is to open the contact window by typing Contact into the Find Anything
			search on the Dashboard, and then typing the contact's last name in to the quick search
			window. This will find matching contacts based on the text you have entered.</para>
		<para>The filters and tag groups in the left hand side of the window are also a quick way to
			find contacts. For example, if you have the core filter 'students currently enrolled'
			ticked, and select a subject tag, like 'computers' you will see a list of results
			returned showing all the students who are currently enrolled in a class for a course
			tagged with a computer tag.</para>
		<para>You will see that some tag groups appear multiple times in the window, for example the
			subject tags (for students enrolled) and the subjects tag (for tutors teaching). You can
			use these tags on their own, or combination with other filters and queries to create a
			powerful range of search options.</para>
		<para>If you wish to search for contacts based on other criteria, you can do an Advanced
			Search by typing a query into the search bar at the bottom of the window. These searches
			require you to type out the query, which can seem difficult at first, but we provide
			context sensitive search options via a drop down box that appears while you type to help
			make this much simpler. For more on how to effectively use Advanced Search to build
			queries, have a read of the Advanced Query Language section of our <link

				query can be quite powerful. For example, if you know you regularly deliver training
				to students with additional needs who are supported by agencies, if you have set up
				this relationship type and made relationship joins between agencies and clients, you
				can then find all the agents you worked with recently, and send them information
				about upcoming courses that may interest their clients.</para>
			<para>When you run a 'Find related...' search, the results open in a new list window,
				and you can continue to run searches on that returned list of results to further
				refine your data.</para>
			<para>At a glance, for a single contact, be it a tutor, student or company, you can find
				all their related enrolments, drill down through all their invoices and payments,
				check the printing or revoked status of each of their certificates or analyse the
				mailing lists they have subscribed to. For a group of contacts, this search function
				provides powerful marketing opportunities and the ability to analyse your student
				base in a variety of ways. </para>

		<title>Merging contacts</title>
		<para>On occasion you will find two contacts records in onCourse that belong to the same
			person. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a typo in a name, a change of
			name between enrolments or via an online enrolment where the returning student uses a
			different email address. When you notice a potential duplicate, it is easy to compare
			and merge the records.</para>
		<para>The merge process allows you to choose the preferred contact details of the student,
			and then merge together the enrolment, outcome, prior learning and financial history of
			the two students into a single record.</para>
		<para>onCourse includes special validation to prevent the merging of contacts who both are
			enrolled in the same class or have different verified USIs. Otherwise, any two contacts
			can potentially be merged into one. If you have contacts where you have located records
			in triplicate, then you will need to merge two of records first, then merge the
			remaining two records into one final record.</para>
		<para>To merge to contacts, in the contact list view, single click to highlight both
			records.</para>
		<para>Go to the cogwheel option in the top right hand corner and select 'merge 2 selected
			contacts'.</para>

		<para>A new merge window will open. In this window differences between the two records will
			be displayed, and you'll also be shown a predicted match score as a percentage. You can
			choose which data to retain by selecting either option A or B. Any choices without a
			selection will be marked with red text prompting you to make a selection. You can also
			hide the already matching fields by switching the 'Only show differences' switch to
			on.</para>
		<para>Selected options will display themselves with a highlight and a green tick. Any
			further changes to fields that are blank will need to be completed after the merging
			process is done.</para>
		<para>Once you have confirmed the data choices for the contact is correct and all relevant
			fields have been selected, the Merge button will highlight. Choose 'Merge' to perform
			the final merge. Please note that there is no undo option, so you must be certain before
			finalising the merge.</para>
		<para>When contacts have been merged, a note will be auto-populated into their record saying
			'Merged student (student number) by onCourse (user name) on Tue 1 Sep 2015 12:08pm'. You
			can search contact notes for the words 'merged' or a specific student number if you need
			to find a contact who has been merged.</para>
