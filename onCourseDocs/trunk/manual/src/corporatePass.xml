    <title>CorporatePass</title>
    <para>CorporatePass is way to allow certain students to enrol online without having to pay up
        front. Instead their company (usually their employer) is sent the invoice. A password/code
        allows the student to bypass upfront payment and allow them to enrol in a set of limited
        classes or your entire range of classes. You can create as many CorporatePasses as you like
        for the same customer, and for as many different customers as you choose.</para>

                <para>You may have a large customer with a number of staff to whom you provide
                    training. Without CorporatePass your choices are to have the staff enrol online
                    with their own credit card or some corporate credit card, or to process the
                    enrolments by hand in the office in conjunction with your customer's HR
                    department. This involves a lot of co-ordination to check each student's
                    availability. Instead, CorporatePass allows you to give the customer's HR
                    department a password or set of passwords. They then hand them out to staff
                    according to their own rules and policies. Staff can then enrol in whichever
                    classes are most suitable to their own availability. </para>

                <para>Perhaps you are using onCourse to track internal training delivery in your
                    company. You might want to assign a price to classes to help with
                    interdepartmental cost allocation. CorporatePass gives you the ability to create
                    a separate password for each department, allow staff to book their own training,
                    and then perform the backend accounting you require. </para>

                <para>You deliver vocational training to the staff of several large mining
                    companies. These staff need to be regularly accredited for some part of their
                    job, but they have some flexibility to do their training around their work
                    shifts. You can create a special landing page on your website for each of those
                    companies, with links to the courses you deliver that are relevant to them, the
                    password for CorporatePass and all other relevant information. Then students are
                    directed to that page for all their training information. </para>

                <para>Students have to complete an audition or interview process to get into your

                    sign up to further training and tie their payments into a monthly billing
                    process you already have in place. Just hand them a password and they can enrol
                    24 hours a day over the internet. </para>

                    who will be able to monitor the emails and ensure that staff are enrolling in
                    appropriate training. These emails are sent in almost real time, so you
                    typically have plenty of time to review and reject any extraneous

            <para>A Corporate Pass can also have a negative discount linked to it. This works exactly
                the same way as if a positive discount is linked one, however instead of the 'Total'
                getting decreased it gets increased, as shown below. If a Corporate Pass has both a
                postive and negative discount link to it, the negative discount always takes
                precedent over the positive one.</para>

            how many times a given CorporatePass has been used. You can also filter the view to only
            show current entries using the Core Filter function of this window.</para>
