		<subtitle>Navigating the list and record windows</subtitle>
		<para>All records in onCourse can be viewed in either a list view or record view. You need to
			open the list view to access individual records.</para>
		<para>To access the course records go to either the splash screen and click on
				<guibutton>Course</guibutton> or the onCourse menu <menuchoice>
				<guimenuitem>Courses</guimenuitem>
				<guisubmenu>Courses</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice> . This will open the Course list view window.</para>
		<section>
			<title>The onCourse list view</title>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para> Parts of the window - On the right hand part of the window are the course records
						listed in a summary view. The title bar shows you how many records you have. The top
						section of the window contains the search function and the add and delete records
						button. You will also find a cog wheel button that allows for special functions for one
						or more records in the list. In the left hand side of the list window are quick searches
						to enable you to work with groups of data. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> Record summaries - The list of records in this window allows you to enter a record
						by double clicking, or select the record to perform special functions by single
						clicking. A selected record will be highlighted. You can select one or more records in
						the list by using shift-click to select a range, or control-click to select a group of
						individual records. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> Columns and sorting - Column headings can be used to sort records in the list.
						Click on the header to sort in alphabetical order. Click it again to sort by reverse
						alphabetical order. You can also drag the columns around and modify their width to set
						your preferred layout. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Quick Search - By typing the first few letters of the course name into the quick
						search field, you can reduce the list of records to those that match.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Advanced Search - can be accessed by clicking on the Magnifying glass image in the
						quick search field. This will open the query editor to allow you to choose which fields
						and which data you want to search on. You can add multiple criteria to your
						searches.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Saved Searches - After performing an advanced search, you can choose to save the
						search parameters to allow you to quickly run the search again. To save a search, click
						on the cogwheel within the query editor and select 'save find'. The saved search will
						appear in the left hand part of the window.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Tag Grups - Any tag groups you have created that relate to courses, like Subject,
						will appear here. By checking any of these check boxes you will see the list of records
						on the right hand side reduced to records that match that criteria. You can tag records
						in bulk by selecting a group of records on the right and right clicking on a tag name on
						the left.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Core filters - reduce the list of records to those that match the filter criteria.
						By default, most onCourse windows open with filters applied so you are only working with
						your current records. You can switch core filters on and off by ticking the
						checkboxes.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<tip>
				<para>Filters and searches work together in onCourse. If you run an search and do not see
					the result you expect, this may be because a filter that is checked is preventing the
					record you are searching for from being displayed.</para>
			</tip>
			<para>You can enter a course record by double clicking on it in the window.</para>

			<title>Creating Courses</title>
			<para>A course is the subject being delivered. Courses are your college's product. They are
				what your business sells. They may be accredited or non-accredited, part time, full time or
				just one time. </para>
			<para>For example, a course might be Jewellery Making for Beginners, Advanced Belly Dancing or
				MYOB for Professionals. A course can have many classes and each class can run for one or
				more sessions. </para>
			<para>By setting up courses, you have something to advertise. You will need to name and
				describe your courses in order to entice your students to enrol. </para>
			<tip>
				<para>You need only enter the course name and course code to create your courses in
					onCourse, you can return to the record later more information, like a description for your
					website or print marketing. </para>
			</tip>
			<example>
				<title>How to create a new course</title>
				<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Click on the the <guibutton>+</guibutton> button in the top right hand corner of
							the screen. A new course screen will open on the general tab. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para> Enter a name for your course and a course code in the relevant fields. Your
							course code must be unique, that is a code not used by any other course already
							created. Please note that the course code must not have any spaces between characters.
							So the course code for “Dancing for Beginners 1”, written using the first letter of
							each word, must be entered as DFB1 and not DFB 1.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>If you want students to be able to go on the waiting list for this course check
							the <guilabel>allows waiting lists</guilabel> box. The <guilabel>currently
								offered</guilabel> box will be checked by default. This allows you to create classes
							later on. If you decide to retire this course from your list of offerings you can
							uncheck this later. Courses that aren't currently offered can not have new classes
							created for them.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Below is the <guilabel>print brochure description</guilabel> box. There are two options
							for entering descriptions: print brochure description on the general
							tab, and web description on the marketing tab. Usually, print materials
							are limited to descriptions of two or three lines, whereas on the web,
							your space is unlimited. If you do not intend to use onCourse to create
							a print based brochure, you do not need to enter any information in the
							print brochure description field. Text entered here can later be
							exported in an XML format ready for import into a print design product
							like Adobe InDesign.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Move to the marketing tab. Text entered in the web description field can be written in
							rich text format. A guide to using rich text can be found here <xref
								xlink:href="#richtext.html"/> You can preview the text by hovering
							over the blue A at the bottom of the text field. You can also attach
							images, files or documents to the web page. To advertise this course
							online, select <guilabel>Enabled and visible online</guilabel> in the
							general tab.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para> When you have entered your information, click <guibutton>save</guibutton> and you
							will be returned to the course list page. Notice that the course you have entered is
							now listed. You can return to edit this course at any time by double clicking on
							it.</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
			</example>
			<caution>
				<title>Field Validation</title>
				<para>You will notice that before entering text, the course and code box is coloured pink.
					Once you have entered valid text the colouring disappears. Should the box remain pink, it
					means that you have not entered the text correctly and need to review your entry. You will
					not be able to save the record as the save button will be disabled. There will be a
					warning icon that will provide you with information as to why the data you have entered is
					not accepted if you hover over it.</para>
			</caution>

		<section>
			<title>Setting Up Course Relationships</title>
			<para>onCourse allows you to link related courses and products to a given Course. This is an invaluable tool from a marketing perspective as it enables you to cross sell related or similar courses.</para>
			<para>You can add related Courses via the following steps:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Go to the Marketing tab of the Course and click on the <guiicon>+</guiicon> symbol to create a new Course relationship. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Enter the name of the Course / Course code and click ok within the dialogue box.</para>

		<title>VET Courses</title>
		<para>If you are an RTO who offers short accredited programs, or full qualifications, you will
			appreciate the ease in which you can set up your courses with the right unit and qualification
			details. This then flows through to recording outcomes, creating transcripts and
			certifications, and generating AVETMISS compliant data.</para>
		<para>You must ensure that in the File > General > Preferences > AVETMISS you have the 'show RTO
			related screens and menus' option enabled. This makes the VET tabs in the course and class
			records and the AVETMISS tab in the student record visible for data entry.</para>
		<para>In the VET tab of the course record you can select the Qualification and the Units from
			the built in NTIS data for your chosen course. If your course is VET, but not from a training
			package or accredited course, you can also flag it VET here and allocate its Field of
			Education ID. This is something you may need to do as part of your government funding
			requirements for non accredited courses.</para>
		<tip>
			<para>Do you deliver state accredited courses? You will find the course listed in onCourse but
				not the modules that make up the course. This is because they are not publicly available on
				NTIS. You can send us the modules names and codes and we manually add them to onCourse for
				you.</para>
		</tip>
		<para>onCourse does not contain the qualification packaging rules, so it is up to you as the RTO
			to ensure that you are compliant with your own scope of registration and the requirements of
			the training packages you are authorised to deliver. You should refer to these requirements
			when creating your courses and only select those units which are allowed to contribute towards
			that particular qualification.</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<title>There are a few different ways you can structure VET Courses within onCourse:</title>
			<listitem>
				<para> A full Qualification where you know all the units the students will complete in
					advance i.e. all students will complete the same core and elective units. Students will
					graduate with a complete Qualification.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A full Qualification where all students will undertake the core units, but may all
					select different elective units. Students will graduate with a complete
					Qualification.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A short course which has one or more units of competency embedded within it. The units
					may or may not all contribute to the same Qualification. Students will graduate with a
					Statement of Attainment.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A short course where you know which qualification a student will be working towards in
					advance, but the students in the class will complete a variable number and selection of
					units. Some may achieve a Statement of Attainment, some may be working towards a full
					Qualification, and some may simply receive a non-vet Statement of Attendance.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A course which is not linked to any national or state accredited training packages or
					accredited courses, but has a vocational learning outcome. Depending on your reporting
					requirements, these courses may also contribute towards your annual VET delivery.</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>In onCourse outcomes (records of undertaking and achieving a unit of competency) flow down
			from the course to the student via an enrolment in a class. If a course has 15 units attached
			to it, when a student is enrolled in a class for that course, the student will have 15
			outcomes created for them - one for each unit. You can always modify the units for the student
			in their own enrolment, for example if they change to a different elective. What this means is
			that you can save yourself a lot of data entry work if you set your course up with all the
			units to begin with. </para>
		<caution xml:id="immutableCaution">
			<title>Changing units in a course</title>
			<para>Once a course has a class with an enrolment in it you CAN NOT change the units of
				competency assigned to the course. This is because onCourse has created an immutable
				relationship with this data - if you changed it at the course level, every student ever
				enrolled in a class for this course would have their outcomes changed. You can always retire
				the old course and create a new course to use in the future. The new course can have the
				same name but will have to have a different course code. This type of issue can be tricky,
				so take care when going through the steps. Remember that if an immutable (state cannot be
				modified after it has been set) relationship in onCourse is formed, it is quite hard to
				remove or delete any half of the relationship. Immutable relationships are formed so as to
				restrict or deny any removal of vital database elements, like a course, if a course was
				allowed to be removed at the click of button, things like classes, students, invoices,
				payments etc will be adversely affected.</para>
		</caution>
		<example>
			<title>How to "remove" a unit of competency from a class</title>
			<para>You cannot actually remove a Unit of competency from a course (see the red caution box
				on the right), you can only cancel the old course and then create a new course with/without
				the unit of competency you want included/removed. This is because changing the units of
				competency changes the very nature of the course. It isn't the same course as before and
				students enrolling in the new version of your course should be aware that they are enrolling
				into something quite different from the old course</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<title>What to do to achieve this:</title>
				<listitem>
					<para>First go to "Course", from here double click on the course record e.g; Computers -
						Beginners"</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once opened, disable the course by selecting "course disabled" from the "status"
						drop down menu in the "general tab" (see screenshot below)</para>

			<title>How can I create a VET course where the students are completing a partial unit of
				competency?</title>
			<para>Remember that in onCourse a course is about the product you are selling to your
				students. Sometimes you may break a program of study e.g. full qualification into lots of
				short courses for students to buy, complete and over time, work towards the final outcome of
				a qualification.</para>
			<para>In onCourse, courses don't have to be linked to a qualification or a unit of competency.
				They can just be a non-accredited course.</para>
			<para>If students are working towards a unit of competency that they will complete in another
				course, you may like to indicate this in the program description that you use for marketing
				purposes. If the student only completes this course, they will only be eligible for a
				non-accredited Certificate of Attendance, not a Statement of Attainment.</para>
			<para>You can set up this type of program in onCourse by attaching the Qualification that the
				student will be working towards in the VET tab of the course, but not adding any Units of
				Competency to the course. You do not have to add the Qualification at all - this is
				optional, and would not be appropriate if the program of study never led to any formal
				Qualification outcome.</para>
			<para>When students enrol in this course, they will get a dummy outcome (used for reporting
				purposes in some states) with the name of the course. You can set this dummy outcome to pass
				(81) or fail (82). Using this outcome, you will then know when the student enrols in the
				next course (where the units have been attached) that they have successfully completed the
				part one component.</para>
			<para>When you set up the second part of the course, you will add the qualification and the
				units to the VET tab, so when the student enrols they will get the appropriate units of
				competency added to their record. Then you are able to record their final outcome result as
				per the standard list of VET options.</para>
			<para>In the example below, a student is working towards a cluster of units from the
				Certificate I in IT. Only when they have completed the second course, Understanding Computer
				Basics, are they eligible to be assessed against the unit outcomes. The first course,
				Computing Basics, has no units attached, and the second course has three units attached. </para>
