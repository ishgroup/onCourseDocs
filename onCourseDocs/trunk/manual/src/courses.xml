					<listitem>
						<para>Click on the <guibutton>+</guibutton> icon in the bottom right hand
							corner of the screen. A new course screen will open, focused on the
							general section. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para> Enter a name for your course and a course code in the relevant
							fields. Your course code must be unique, that is a code not used by any
							other course already created. Please note that the course code must not
							have any spaces between characters. So the course code for 'Dancing for
							Beginners 1', written using the first letter of each word, must be
							entered as DFB1 and not DFB 1. </para>
						<para>The code used will also become the course page URL on your website
							e.g. www.mycollege.com/course/DFB1. You can enter up to 32 characters in
							this field, so if you wish to create good URLs for SEO purposes, you
							could make your code longer, for example DanceClassStage1 to create the
							URL www.mycollege.com/course/DanceClassStage1</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>You can add one or more tags to your course record by clicking the
								<guibutton>+</guibutton> button directly below the Course Name, near
							the top of the window. The default tag group used to drive your onCourse
							website is called 'Subjects'. If you add a tag from this group, your
							course will be available to users browsing your website. More
							information about tagging is available in the <link

						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>There are two choices of <guilabel>enrolment type</guilabel> that
							relate to enrolments processed over the website. <guilabel>Open
								enrolment</guilabel> means students can enrol and pay directly on
							the web. This is the default setting. <link
								xlink:href="applications.html">Enrolment by application</link> means

								<guilabel>allows waiting lists</guilabel> box. This box is checked
							by default.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Below is the <guilabel>print brochure description</guilabel> box.
							There are two options for entering descriptions: print brochure
							description on the general tab, and web description in the Marketing
							section. Usually, print materials are limited to descriptions of two or
							three lines, whereas on the web, your space is unlimited. If you do not
							intend to use onCourse to create a print based brochure, you do not need
							to enter any information in the print brochure description field. <link

			<caution>
				<title>Field Validation</title>
				<para>You will notice that before entering data, the course and code box is coloured
					red. Once you have entered valid text the colouring disappears. Should the box
					remain red, it means that you have not entered the data correctly and need to
					review your entry. You will not be able to save the record as the save button
					will be disabled. There will be a warning icon that will provide you with
					information as to why the data you have entered is not accepted if you hover
					over it.</para>

		<title>Writing course descriptions for the web</title>
		<para>The onCourse website is a powerful marketing tool for promoting your products to the
			public. Your ability to explain your product point of difference and entice students to
			enrol is determined by the copy you write in your course Marketing tab.</para>
		<section>
			<title> What does a good course description include? </title>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>The first sentence or two of your course description should contain your
						hook. This is the copy that displays in the course list results and 'reels
						in' the customer, enticing them to click on the link [more...] Avoiding
						using headings in the first paragraph for the same reason - it won't render
						well in list views or make sense to readers browsing your site.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Think about all the questions potential students ask about this course,
						and provide answers in the course copy. onCourse already helps answer the
						'where and when' questions with google maps embedded, and a full class
						timetable. It's the internet - there is no limit to the amount of
						information you can provide. Give students full confidence that this is the
						right course for them so they can click 'enrol now', instead of having to
						pick up the phone to ask you for more information.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Break up your copy with headings. It's difficult to scan large blocks of
						text, so put your rich text skills to good use and separate content with
						headings like 'What to bring', 'What you will learn', 'What past students
						say'. <link
							xlink:href="http://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/web/richText.html"
							>Review rich text options here</link>
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>An image is worth a thousand words. Show, rather than tell, what your
						students can achieve if they enrol in this course. Learning Thai Cooking?
						Show them a dish they will cook in class. There are a thousands of enticing
						stock photography images available for purchase online, and the onCourse
						system makes it easy for you to attach them to a course and upload them to
						your website.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Keep the technical language to a minimum. If you are selling vocational
						training it's easy to fall into using acronyms and terms that only make
						sense to people within the industry. Your potential students are here to
						learn - don't scare them off enrolling by assuming they have the same
						industry knowledge you have.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Avoid negative language. Your course description is not the place to tell
						people they can't access refunds if they change their mind after enrolment.
						Save it for your Terms and Conditions page.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>What is SEO and why is it important?</title>
			<para>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation and having a website with 'good' SEO
				should mean your site appears near the top of the list for searches that are most
				relevant to your product. A large part of SEO is technical - i.e. can the Google
				bots that crawl the internet read and understand your website's content? The
				technical framework that underpins the onCourse web engine does most of this hard
				work for you, but one thing we can't automate is the creation of your website
				content.</para>
			<para>There are plenty of companies out there who will try to sell you an SEO solution,
				but the one thing most of them lack is an experienced copy writer who knows your
				product and your market. </para>
			<para>Writing enticing copy is a skill. Making sure this copy hits on appropriate
				keywords and still reads well is an art. </para>
			<para>Keywords are the terms people use when they are searching for your product. If you
				have an <link xlink:href="https://adwords.google.com.au">AdWords account with
					Google</link>, they have an excellent Keyword Planner tool that allows you
				search for keywords and find related terms people search for, with their relative
				search frequency.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Tips for writing SEO copy</title>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Your key search term belongs in your course name, which in turn becomes
						your website page title and heading level content in the results pages.
						Words appearing in titles and headings are ranked higher than text on the
						page. For example, the course name 'Learn Microsoft Excel' would be a higher
						ranking course name for SEO purposes than 'Excel 101'</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The first paragraph of text on the page should reuse your primary keywords
						and add in your top related keywords, while remaining readable to humans.
						Say for example you chose the primary keyword Microsoft Office Excel with
						related keywords MS excel, formulas, spreadsheets, help, online, free, and
						your generic location. Your first paragraph would read: "Our Canberra CBD
						courses in Microsoft Office Excel are the solution to learning excel
						formulas and other spreadsheet functions. MS Excel training will help
						progress your career in almost any industry. Online classes for Excel are
						also available or you can attend classroom tutorials and then access our
						online Excel course for free."</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If you're selling education, keywords like learn, course, class, training
						and tutorial belong in every course description you write. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If you're selling face to face training, make sure you use location based
						keywords that relate to your training venues in the course copy, don't just
						rely on the class location to 'sell' to the local market.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Encouraging people to link back to your content is also a great way to
						improve your native page ranks. onCourse websites have <link
							xlink:href="www.addthis.com">built in tools for AddThis</link>, but to
						encourage links you need to provide content worth sharing. Consider
						providing content beyond the sales pitch - some Excel hints and tips may be
						just the trick to keep visitors returning.</para>

		<title>VET Courses</title>
		<para>If you are an RTO who offers short accredited programs, or full qualifications, you
			will appreciate the ease in which you can set up your courses with the right unit and
			qualification details. This then flows through to recording outcomes, creating
			transcripts and certifications, and generating AVETMISS compliant data.</para>
		<tip>
			<para>In this section when we talk about Qualifications we really mean "Qualifications,
				Accredited Courses or Skillsets". And when we say "Unit of Competency" we also
				include "Modules". Although the words are different between state and commonwealth
				accreditation regimes, the processes in onCourse are exactly the same.</para>
		</tip>
		<para>You must ensure that in the Preferences > AVETMISS section you have the 'show RTO
			related screens and menus' checkbox option enabled. This makes the VET section in the
			course and class records and the AVETMISS section in the student record visible for data
			entry.</para>
		<para>In the VET tab of the course record you can select the Qualification and the Units
			from the built in NTIS data for your chosen course. If your course is VET, but not from
			a training package or accredited course, you can also flag it VET here and allocate its
			Field of Education ID. This is something you may need to do as part of your government
			funding requirements for non accredited courses.</para>
		<tip>
			<para>Do you deliver state accredited courses? You will find the course listed in
				onCourse but not the modules that make up the course. This is because they are not
				publicly available on NTIS. You can send us the modules names, codes and field of
				Education IDs in a spreadsheet and we will manually add them to onCourse for
				you.</para>
		</tip>
		<para>onCourse does not contain the qualification packaging rules, so it is up to you as the
			RTO to ensure that you are compliant with your own scope of registration and the
			requirements of the training packages you are authorised to deliver. You should refer to
			these requirements when creating your courses and only select those units which are
			allowed to contribute towards that particular qualification.</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<title>There are a few different ways you can structure VET Courses within
				onCourse:</title>
			<listitem>
				<para> A full Qualification where you know all the units the students will complete
					in advance i.e. all students will complete the same core and elective units.
					Students will graduate with a complete Qualification.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A full Qualification where all students will undertake the core units, but may
					all select different elective units. Students will graduate with a complete
					Qualification.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A short course which has one or more units of competency embedded within it.
					The units may or may not all contribute to the same Qualification. Students will
					graduate with a Statement of Attainment.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A short course where you know which qualification a student will be working
					towards in advance, but the students in the class will complete a variable
					number and selection of units. Some may achieve a Statement of Attainment, some
					may be working towards a full Qualification, and some may simply receive a
					non-vet Statement of Attendance.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A course which is not linked to any national or state accredited training
					packages or accredited courses, but has a vocational learning outcome. Depending
					on your reporting requirements, these courses may also contribute towards your
					annual VET delivery.</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>In onCourse outcomes (records of undertaking and achieving a unit of competency) flow
			down from the course to the student via an enrolment in a class. If a course has 15
			units attached to it, when a student is enrolled in a class for that course, the student
			will have 15 outcomes created for them - one for each unit. You can always modify the
			units for the student in their own enrolment, for example if they change to a different
			elective. What this means is that you can save yourself a lot of data entry work if you
			set your course up with all the units to begin with. </para>

			<caution xml:id="courses-immutableCaution">
				<title>Changing units in a course with enrolments</title>
				<para>Once a course has a class with an enrolment in it you CAN NOT change the units
					of competency assigned to the course. This is because onCourse has created an
					immutable relationship with this data - if you changed it at the course level,
					every student ever enrolled in a class for this course would have their outcomes
					changed. </para>
				<para>However - you can always retire the old course and create a new course to use
					for future enrolment using the 'duplicate course' option in the list view
					cogwheel. The new course can have the same name but will have to have a
					different course code. You may choose to change the code of the old course
					instead, so the new course can use the existing code, which is advantageous for
					your SEO. Make sure to set the status of the old course to 'course disabled' and
					when you are ready, the status of the new course to 'enabled and visible
					online'. </para>
				<para>You may also want to duplicate one of the classes from the old course and
					assign it to the new course to use the same timetables and teaching schedules.
				</para>
			</caution>
			<example>
				<title>More information on changing units</title>
				<para>You cannot actually add a Unit of competency to a course if it already has
					enrolments (see the caution above), you can only cancel the old course and then
					create a new course with the additional unit of competency you want included.
					This is because changing the units of competency changes the very nature of the
					course, but the history of the old course and it's previous students need to be
					retained. </para>
				<para>If needed, you can also add units directly to student enrolments. This will
					not change the course units for new students enrolling, but can be used to
					correct or update the records of existing students.</para>
				<para>If the unit change is substantial, you may want to consider creating a new
					class against the new course, and transferring all the students from the class
					linked to the old course to the class linked to the new course. This will remove
					all the old units from their record (provided outcomes have not yet been set),
					and with their new enrolment, add all the new units to their record.</para>

			<title>Courses which are complete qualifications or skill sets</title>
			<para>When a course has the flag 'Satisfies complete qualification or skill set' checked
				on the VET tab, this means that if the student successfully completes all of the
				attached units, they will be eligible for a Qualification or Skill Set Statement of
				Attainment. </para>
			<para>Using the automatic 'create Certificates' options from the class or enrolment
				cogwheels will look at the value of this flag and determine what type of
				certification to create.</para>
			<para>This flag, for AVETMISS purposes, also signifies the student's intent to complete
				a qualification. Outcomes linked to a class with this flag checked will be reported
				linked to the parent qualification, where courses where this isn't selected will be
				reported as module only enrolments.</para>
			<para>This value of this checkbox can be changed as needed after the course has been
				created, and even after students have enrolled.</para>

			<title>Partial qualifications</title>
			<para>Remember that in onCourse a course is about the product you are selling to your
				students. Sometimes you may break a program of study e.g. full qualification into
				lots of short courses for students to buy, complete and over time, to work towards
				the final outcome of a qualification.</para>
			<para>In onCourse, courses don't have to be linked to a qualification or a unit of
				competency. They can just be a non-accredited course.</para>
			<para>If students are working towards a unit of competency that they will complete in
				another course, you may like to indicate this in the program description that you
				use for marketing purposes. If the student only completes this course, they will
				only be eligible for a non-accredited Certificate of Attendance, not a Statement of
				Attainment.</para>
			<para>You can set up this type of program in onCourse by attaching the Qualification
				that the student will be working towards in the VET tab of the course, but not
				adding any Units of Competency to the course. You do not have to add the
				Qualification at all - this is optional, and would not be appropriate if the program
				of study never led to any formal Qualification outcome.</para>
			<para>When students enrol in this course, they will get a dummy outcome (used for
				reporting purposes in some states) with the name of the course. You can set this
				dummy outcome to pass (81) or fail (82). Using this outcome, you will then know when
				the student enrols in the next course (where the units have been attached) that they
				have successfully completed the part one component.</para>
			<para>When you set up the second part of the course, you will add the qualification and
				the units to the VET tab, so when the student enrols they will get the appropriate
				units of competency added to their record. Then you are able to record their final
				outcome result as per the standard list of VET options.</para>
			<para>In the example below, a student is working towards a cluster of units from the
				Certificate I in IT. Only when they have completed the second course, Understanding
				Computer Basics, are they eligible to be assessed against the unit outcomes. The
				first course, Computing Basics, has no units attached, and the second course has
				three units attached. </para>
