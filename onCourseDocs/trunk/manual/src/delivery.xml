		<title>During Enrolment and Delivery</title>
		<para>Right, that's everything you need to take care of before letting students hand over their
			money to enrol in your courses. All you need to worry about from this point is what to
			do while you're delivering training, but before you hit the 'Export' button on the
			AVETMISS runner to collate all your reporting data. </para>

			<title>Enrolment</title>
			<para>You are required to validate each student's USI against their first name, last name and
				date of birth with the USI Registry System. If you have an onCourse support plan and
				have correctly set up your USI Integration in onCourse, onCourse will do this
				automatically for each USI supplied. For more information on creating and validating
				USIs, please refer to the <link xlink:href="uniqueStudentIdentifier.html#usi">USI

				<title>Client Tuition Fee</title>
				<para>This is the fee you charged the student at the time of enrolment, divided by

					class fee in the Class General tab. VET courses are usually GST exempt. During
					the enrolment process, you can charge the student the full fee or give them a
					manual discount if they meet fee exemption criteria. The fee they pay here is
					what is reported. If you don't usually use onCourse for invoicing and payment
					records, create a full cash payment for each student on enrolment. Don't worry
					about the invoices that are automatically created here - they have nothing to do
					with AVETMISS.</para>

		<section>
			<title>What are outcomes?</title>
			<para>A students outcome is the record of their engagement with a Unit of Competency or
				Module from a training package or accredited course. Outcomes are often reported to
				government through processes such as AVETMISS and must meet certain validation
				rules. Primarily, an outcome records if a student has passed or failed their course.
				The outcomes available for selection are as follows:</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member> Competency achieved/pass (20)</member>
				<member> Competency not achieved/fail (30)</member>
				<member> Withdrawn (40)</member>
				<member> Recognition of prior learning granted (51)</member>
				<member> Recognition of prior learning not granted (52)</member>
				<member> Recognition of current competency granted (53)</member>
				<member> Recognition of current competency not granted (54)</member>
				<member> Credit transfer (60)</member>
				<member> Did not start (NSW: 66, SA: @@)</member>
				<member> Continuing enrolment (70) *</member>

			</simplelist>
			<para>Refer to the NCVER publications, VET Provider Collection Specifications and
				AVETMISS Data Element Definitions for more information regarding the definitions and
				use of these outcomes.</para>
			<para>* You do not need to set the outcome 'Continuing enrolment (70)' for any outcomes.
				During the AVETMISS export process, if the outcome end date is in the calendar year
				after the date range of the export, 70 will automatically be exported. </para>
			<para>** If you export data for non-VET outcomes, you do not need to set the outcome
				'Non-assessed enrolment - Satisfactorily completed (81)'. This will always be
				exported for unset non-VET outcomes. </para>
			<para>*** You may not need to set 'Result not available (90)'. During the export

				<title>Finding outcomes</title>
				<para>Outcome data is available in the enrolment record, the student record, the
					class record and via the 'Find related' outcomes option.</para>
				<para>Go to the Outcomes window to see all outcomes in the database. The outcomes

				<para>To see outcomes related to a particular record, such as an enrolment record,
					double click on the enrolment and navigate to the outcomes tab. You can do the
					same thing in a class to see all outcome records for the students enrolled in

			<title>Importing and adding prior learning</title>
			<para>If you are migrating to onCourse from another AVETMISS compliant student

				Certificate records in onCourse and also be exported out as AVETMISS data.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Manually adding prior learning records</title>
				<para>The education tab of a student record is comprised of four sections -
					enrolments, prior learning, outcomes and certificates. In onCourse, both
					enrolments and prior learning can be vocational, and linked to one or more units
					of competency or be non-vet and linked to no formal study units.</para>
				<para>To add prior learning to a student record, click on the + option to the right
					of the prior learning panel.</para>
				<para>Prior learning must have a title - this can be descriptive of the course or
					training conducted elsewhere. Optionally, the prior learning record can be
					linked to a Qualification or Skills Set on the general tab, contain reference to
					an external system reference number e.g. the course code or enrolment code from
					the previous system and optional descriptive notes.</para>
				<para>On the second tab, outcomes, you can manually add one or more units of
					competency or accredited modules to the prior learning record. It is important
					you add start and end dates to the units of competency, and a valid outcome
					status here if you want to report them for AVETMISS or use the unit to create a
					certificate. If you are adding units completed at another RTO, you should record
					the outcome status as 'Credit Transfer'.</para>
				<para>If you scan any documents, such as a copy of their Certificate, you can add
					them to the prior learning record also. You will just need to make sure you save
					the prior learning record first, before adding documents.</para>
				<para>Once the prior learning record has been saved, the outcomes attached to the
					prior learning will appear in the outcomes section of the student's education
					record, combined with any outcomes completed by the student via enrolments into
					onCourse classes.</para>

		<title>Understanding how outcomes are attached to enrolments</title>
		<para>When a VET course is created, qualifications, accredited courses, skillsets, modules and
			units of competency are set at the course level. More information about setting up VET
			courses is available in the <link xlink:href="courses.html#courses-VET">Courses chapter
				of our documentation</link>. Classes for the course inherit the units set at the
			course level. You can see these units by clicking the button under Outcomes in the class
			record.</para>
		<para>When a student enrols in the class, the units of competency attached to the course become
			the outcomes attached to the student's enrolment. The start and end date of class become
			the start and end date of the outcomes, unless you choose to define different dates in
			the training plan. The settings in the class VET section become the default settings for
			each outcome for that class, but can be changed on an outcome by outcome basis. Within
			the class level outcomes can be changed or set, but can not be deleted and new outcomes
			can not be added here. </para>
		<para>You can see the outcomes that have been assigned to each student in the class in the
			outcomes section, in the student's record in the enrolment section, and in the enrolment
			record in the outcomes section.</para>
		<para>Via the student's enrolment record, outcomes added in error can be deleted from the
			enrolment record and additional outcomes can be added. Adding or deleting outcomes needs
			to be done per enrolment where training and assessment is taking place at your RTO. For
			outcomes gained in learning outside of onCourse, prior learning records can be imported,
			or manually added to the student's education section.</para>
			<para>Once outcomes are linked to certificates and the certificate is printed and issued, the

				and some students may not wish to be assessed at all. All of these circumstances
				combined can make headaches for the English classes coordinator who both wants to
				make sure the students and tutors needs are met, as well as reporting accurate
				statistics for funding purposes. Don't worry - onCourse has you covered! </para>
			<section>
				<title>Setting up the course</title>
				<para>onCourse includes all the available TGA data relating to accredited courses
					and classes. Unfortunately, TGA isn't able to provide details of accredited
					course modules, but for both the current and recently expired CSWE, we have
					built in all the modules to onCourse so you can select those you deliver.</para>
				<para>If you college chooses different modules for each class, when you create a
					CSWE course, simply add the accredited course code to the VET page but leave the
					module list empty. If you always use the same modules, you can set up your CSWE
					course like any other VET course, with accredited course detail and modules. </para>
				<para>If you do not set any modules in the course, student enrolling in CSWE linked
					classes will be given a VET-flagged but non accredited outcome, named whatever
					your course is named. You will override these outcomes later when you have the
					correct module information for each student.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Enrolling students in CSWE classes.</title>
				<para>You can enrol students in CSWE classes like you would in any other program. It doesn't
					matter if you mix AMEP, BACE and fee paying students together - the outcomes you
					set later on will separate them for AVETMISS purposes.</para>
				<para>We realise many students attending CSWE classes may have enrolled in English
					classes at your college previously. Knowing the student language background,
					what classes they have attended, and what units they have completed will assist
					your tutors in selecting the best units for their current enrolment.</para>
				<para>Once your students are enrolled and classes are ready to start you can print
					the Student Details Report from the class window, which will provide the tutors
					with the information listed above.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Setting CSWE outcomes.</title>
				<para>Once your tutor has reported back to the college each of the outcomes
					attempted and/or achieved by each student in the class, you can enter the data
					into onCourse, ready for your AVETMISS exports.</para>
				<para>Go to the enrolment window and search for all the students in the class group
					you wish to work with by conducting and advanced search on the course code and
					class code.</para>
				<para>The outcome tab of each student's enrolment will show a non-VET outcome. Open
					it and change it to the first CSWE outcome you wish to record. You can also set
					the funding source information in this window. </para>
				<para>You can also add additional outcomes to the enrolment if a student has
					attempted more than one module during this class by clicking the plus
					sign.</para>
				<para>If a student chooses not to be assessed against any outcomes, you either leave them with
					the VET flagged non-accredited outcome or choose a VET outcome and set it to
						<emphasis> 30 - Competency not achieved/fail</emphasis> or if you have
					documented evidence that they have refused assessment, yet successfully attended
					the class, you can set a suitable module outcome to <emphasis> 81 - Non-assessed
						enrolment - Satisfactorily completed</emphasis>

		<title>VET delivery hours</title>
		<para>How and where onCourse records and calculates student contact hours</para>
		<section>
			<title>VET data in the class window</title>
			<para>On the class window, there is a tab called VET, which contains fields that are
				useful for RTOs and relate to AVETMISS and other delivery statistics. There are also
				three AVETMISS specific fields 'Delivery mode', 'Funding source' and 'DET booking
				ID'. </para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Delivery Mode - This refers to how the class is conducted. Most programs
						are classroom based, and this is the default value. You can also change this
						at the outcome level if necessary, e.g. if one student completes the program
						by distance.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Funding Source - This refers to how the class is funded. These are set
						selection of national codes. You can also change the funding source at the
						outcome level, e.g. for AMEP funded students. For more information, visit
						the NCVER site </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>DET Booking ID - This field is specific to the NSW APL report. Visit
						Training Market NSW for more information on reporting and lodging your data
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Information about the qualification, accredited course, skillset, modules and units of competency delivered in your
				class are set at the course level.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Nominal hours, classroom hours and Student Contact Hours</title>
				<para>The following fields in the class relate to your delivery hours and AVETMISS
					reporting. This section has been deliberately made complex to assist our clients
					who are obliged to report AVETMISS for both VET delivery and non-VET
					delivery.</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Qualification Hours - These are the nominal hours set by NCVER for the
							qualification. Often, this field is left blank, which is acceptable for
							AVETMISS. You can also add the nominal hours to the qualification
							yourself in the Qualification table. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Nominal Hours - The nominal hours field in the class is the total of
							the nominal hours of the units of competency assigned to the course.
							While the nominal hours for each unit are usually set by NCVER, you can
							override them or add them where they are missing in Module/Unit of
							Competency record. You can edit these values when you attach units to
							courses by double clicking on the unit record. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Classroom Hours - The total hours you have defined as scheduled activity by setting
							sessions or by defining the minutes per sessions and number of sessions
							on the General tab. This is not reported as part of AVETMISS for real
							VET outcomes - it is for your information only. </para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Reportable Hours - These are the hours that will be reported against
							each enrolment in the NAT00120 file. They default to the nominal hours
							of the units attached to the course. If there are no nominal hours set
							in the unit, i.e. in a non-VET course, the nominal and reportable hours
							will default to the classroom hours. You can override the reportable
							hours field to the classroom hours or any other number that you wish to
							export in it's place for non-VET courses only. For VET courses, you can
							also override the reportable hours in each outcome, if they differ from
							the unit nominal hours. NOTE: If you have created a class which has
							units of competencies assigned and not set nominal hours for these
							units, your contact hours and reported hours for these outcomes will
							always be zero. Reportable hours based on delivery hours only populate
							non-VET outcomes.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Student Contact Hours - This totals the reportable hours in the
							outcomes attached to the class. This can also be simplified to number of
							students x total class nominal hours for most cases, but in VET classes,
							some students may have different units assigned or different reportable
							hours for their units. SCHs are often used by funding bodies to measure
							delivery. If you have not set nominal hours in the units of competency,
							your student contact hours will calculate to zero. If your classes'
							course does not have units of competency assigned to it e.g. it is a
							non-VET course, the student contact hours will by default equal the
							classroom hours x number of students, unless you override the reportable
							hours field in the class.</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>The report Class funding will provide you with summary information, per
					qualification, per funding code of how many student contact hours you have
					delivered over the classes selected for the report. This can be used to check at
					various points during the year, the number of hours you have delivered that
					compare to your funding targets. </para>

	</section>
	<section xml:id="rto-coursesByCluster">
		<title>Courses by Cluster</title>
		<para>How to set up qualifications that are delivered by internal clusters where units of
			competency overlap</para>
		<para> Clusters, in this case, refers to an internal grouping of units of competency that a
			college delivers to break up a qualification into teaching-focused groups of units.
			Sometimes one unit from a qualification may be delivered across multiple clusters, and a
			student must successfully complete the assessments in each cluster to achieve competency
			in the unit. For example the Qualification Certificate IV in Training and Assessment has
			12 units in total, but the four Environment units are assessed in each cluster. The
			course is delivered in three clusters and each cluster has a fee that applies to it. </para>
		<section>
			<title>Creating the Qualification</title>
			<para>Create a new course and attach all the units that you deliver as part of the
				qualification. This is the formal enrolment where you will record the student's
				completion of outcomes once assessment has been sufficiently completed across your
				various clusters.</para>
			<para>This is the course that you will advertise on your website, so make sure you
				include the full course description and information about how you deliver the
				program.</para>
			<para>Next, create a class for this course, entering the dates, student fees and venue
				information. Details on how to create a class is available here. Web enable this
				class so students can enrol. </para>
			<para>You may choose to set up this class as an 'application fee enrolment' and advise
				the students of the full fee within this class description. Do this by setting the
				class fee as the amount you wish them to pay to apply, and ensure your information
				explains what the approval process involves. You will need to contact students who
				apply and inform them of their success or otherwise, and organise payment of the
				full course fees. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Creating the clusters</title>
			<para>The cluster courses that you create are for your scheduling and management
				purposes only. They will not be advertised online, as you will enrol students in
				these classes as appropriate.</para>
			<para>The clusters that you create are not VET courses - do not attach the qualification or units
				of competency to these records. You can put details of the units and content covered
				in the description if you wish.</para>
			<para>Set up each course and class with the assigned rooms, tutors and sessions</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Enrolments and Payment</title>
			<para>As onCourse will invoice students class fees, you can allow students to make full
				payments or part payments at the time of enrolment.</para>
			<para>For example, you could set the full fee on the first class and track students as
				they make payments towards this total amount. Alternatively, you could set up
				multiple classes with fees attached, so students are only invoiced for a portion of
				the course fee each time they are enrolled in a new cluster.</para>
			<para>In the example below, the full qualification has an application fee of $100, paid
				online. Once the student's enrolment has been accepted, they are invoiced $900 for
				the first cluster, and $500 for each of the subsequent clusters, until a total of
				$2000 has been paid.</para>

	<section><title>Quality Indicator Reporting</title><para>All RTOs registered with ASQA must provide an annual summary report to ASQA of their
			performance against the learner engagement and employer satisfaction quality indicators.
			You are required to send a survey to every student who undertakes VET training with your
			college (the Learner Questionnaire), and to every employer with whom you conduct
			traineeships (the Employer Questionnaire). Read more on ASQA's requirements <link xlink:href="http://www.asqa.gov.au/vet-registration/comply-with-your-obligations/quality-indicator-reporting.html">here</link> Remember that students and employers don't have to complete these
			surveys, but you do need to send them out.</para><para>You will need to collate the responses and complete ASQA's Quality Indicator annual summary
			report. The template is available <link xlink:href="http://www.asqa.gov.au/vet-registration/comply-with-your-obligations/quality-indicator-reporting.html">here.</link></para>

			<title>Using SurveyMonkey </title>
			<para>SurveyMonkey is an online survey tool which can help you remove any paper from the
				survey process. SurveyMonkey has some pre-existing templates for the Questionnaires
				so you can get started very quickly. Set up a new account and then add them:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Log in to <link xlink:href="https://www.surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</link></para>
				</listitem>

				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>There is no cost for copying these templates, and SurveyMonkey has some cheap or free
				plans, depending on your usage needs.</para>
		</section>
		<section><title>Other survey tools </title>
			<para>You might also want to look at FormStack, SurveyGizmo,
			Google Forms and wufoo forms as some other survey tools. While you might need to create
			the survey yourself, each of these tools has some interesting strengths.</para></section>
		<section>
			<title>Sending survey links</title>
			<para>There are two ways to send students a link to your survey automatically.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Integrated option</title>
				<para>In this option, onCourse sends SurveyMonkey or SurveyGizmo details of each
					student completing a VET course. The survey tool then sends out an invite to the
					student, with a link to the questionnaire.</para>
				<para>The advantage of this approach is they you can log into your survey tool to
					see a list of all the students who have not yet responded. There are features
					there which allow you to send reminders. You'll need a paid account with the
					survey tool and this option takes a bit more work to set up.</para>
				<para>Information on how to link your onCourse to your Survey Provider Account
					<link xlink:href="https://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/manual/externalintegrations.html#gsc.tab=0">can be found here</link>
				</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Email link to questionnaire</title>
				<para>Alternatively you can just email the student a link to the questionnaire. This
					will work with any third party tool, but you will not easily be able to generate
					a list of students who have not completed the questionnaire. Mostly this doesn't
					matter, because you only have to invite the student to complete, not ensure they
					respond.</para>
				<para>Instructions for getting the <link xlink:href="https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Web-Link-Collector">SurveyMonkey</link> link.</para>
				<para>Instructions for getting the <link xlink:href="https://help.surveygizmo.com/help/share-survey-via-link">SurveyGizmo </link>link.</para>
				<para>These links are then added to an email template that can be sent out to all
					completed students. The records of the emails will be stored in onCourse, while
					the Survey results will be stored on the third party tool. </para>
