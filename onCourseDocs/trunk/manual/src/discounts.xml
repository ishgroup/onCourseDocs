    <title>Discounts</title>
    <para>In an ideal world you'd never have to give students a discount. They would all flock to
        your courses at full price. But discounts can form an integral part of your marketing
        strategy. Used well, they allow you to attract students who would not otherwise have
        enrolled at the full price. Used poorly, they represent income you give away to students who
        would have happily paid full price. In an ideal world, you will sell to each student at the
        maximum price they would have paid. This is called 'differential pricing' and one way to
        achieve it is through well placed discounts. It allows you to set your full price to be
        higher than you would normally, and target those individuals who would be discouraged at
        that price point with special offers.</para>
    <para>This approach has several benefits to some types of colleges: it positions you as a
        premium service, it creates an impression that you are looking after certain special
        customers and it allows you to discount more deeply for certain demographics knowing that
        higher income is coming from others. As an example of this approach look at the airline
        industry: it is very unlikely that the person sitting next to you paid the same for their
        seat as you did. And airlines economic model is a lot like education; your product is
        completely perishable. Once the flight takes off or the class starts, those empty seats can
        never be sold.</para>

                    <para>A discount is an onCourse marketing tool allowing you to sell a class at a
                        reduced price. </para>

                <term>How is the value of a discount calculated? </term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>A discount value may be applied in dollars, percentage or a change the fee
                        to a set amount (where you specify the same fee that will apply for all
                        classes eligible). All discount values are ex GST, meaning GST (if it
                        applies) will be recalculated on the resulting class fee.</para>
                    <para>For example, if a class fee is $150 (inc GST) and you offer a $50
                        discount, the fee the student pays will not be $100.</para>
                    <para>In this instance the class fee is actually $136.36 and the GST is $13.64.
                        When the $50 discount is deducted, the class fee becomes $86.36. GST is now
                        re-calculated on the new class fee to be $8.64 and the total fee payable
                        becomes $95 (inc GST).</para>
                    <para>If the $50 discount is offered on a class where the fee is $150 (ex GST)
                        then the fee payable will be $100 (ex GST). </para>
                    <para>In both instances, your college earns $50 less income by providing the
                        discount. In the example with GST, the government also earns $5 less GST
                        income as the sale cost of your product has been reduced.</para>
                    <para>You can link classes both with and without GST to the same discount policy
                        as the calculation will be determined on each class fee individually.</para>

                                concession such as a seniors card. If a student meets the
                                requirement of the discount, it will be offered automatically on
                                enrolment. If a student is eligible for multiple discounts, the best

                                specified value. Discounts are offered automatically when the

                    <para>Discounts always apply automatically, when the discount conditions have
                        been met. Discounts can be made available for online enrolments, or only for
                        enrolments processed through the office. There are two ways a discount will
                        apply:</para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>Discounts based on the student or invoice meeting an eligibility
                                criteria. This means you have defined some restrictions on who is
                                able to receive this discount when they enrol e.g. students with a
                                senior's card. If the student meets this criteria, or this criteria
                                is added during the enrolment process, the discount will apply.
                                Invoice criteria include the number of enrolments, total invoice
                                value, or the use of a CorporatePass to create the invoice.</para>

                                of a marketing campaign and are designed to be 'shared' amongst your
                                targeted clients and their friends. They do not usually have
                                additional restrictions attached - whoever can supply the
                                promotional code can access the reduced fee. The promotional code
                                has to be supplied at the time of enrolment to access the
                                discount.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>When a student is eligible for more than one type of discount, onCourse
                        will automatically apply the discount that gives the student the best
                        possible price. For example, if a student is eligible for a $10 discount and
                        a 10% discount on a $50 enrolment, the $10 discount will be selected by
                        default.</para>
                    <para>In Quick Enrol, you can change the discount applied to another discount
                        the student is eligible for if that is the business process you wish to
                        follow.</para>
                    <para>Conversely, when one or more negative discounts apply (a surcharge fee for
                        using a corporatePass, for example) the highest fee for the student will be
                        chosen from the discounted, full fees and surcharge fees the student meets
                        the eligibility criteria for,</para>

        <para>The discount window is available under Courses in the navigation menu, or as a
            favourite on the main dashboard. Opening the discount window will show a list view of
            all current discounts. Historical, or inactive discounts are suppressed by default. You
            can view these discounts by selecting 'inactive' from the core filters.</para>

        <para>Double clicking on an item in the list will open the discount edit window. You can
            create a new discount by clicking on the + in the bottom-right hand corner of the list
            view. You can delete a discount by highlighting it, clicking the cogwheel and then
            clicking 'delete record'. Discounts which have been used by students can not be deleted,
            but they can be made inactive by setting an end date in the past. This will not affect
            any discounts already processed.</para>
        <section xml:id="discounts-Value">
            <title>Defining the discount value</title>
            <para>The first section in the discount edit view is the value section. This is where
                you define the way the discount is calculated.</para>
            <para>The name of the discount will appear on the website, on invoices and in finance
                reports so it is important to choose a name that clearly identifies the
                discount.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Value</title>
                <para>A discount percent allows you to define a percentage amount that will be taken off
                    the class enrolment fee. A discount dollar lets you fix a dollar amount that will be
                    taken off the class enrolment fee (note, the classes attached to the discount may
                    have a variety of fees, so a discount dollar will be better for some classes than
                    others). Override fee lets you set a new fee for all the classes linked to the
                    discount.</para>
                <para>At this point, you can also select if the discount will have any minimum or
                    maximum caps or rounding applied to the nearest dollar, 50 cents or 10 cents. </para>
                <para>The discount value set here can optionally be overridden at the class level,
                    to assign varying class fees sharing the same discount name. This option may be
                    especially useful for funded programs like Smart &amp; Skilled. For example, a
                    number of courses and classes can share the discount ‘First Qualification rate'
                    but each class can have it's own discounted price. Double click on the discount
                    in the class budget tab to edit the value for that class.</para>

                <title>Accounting</title>
                <para>Discounts can be set to post to a COS (Cost of Sale) account, or not. If a
                    discount posts to a COS account, this means the full class fee is sent to
                    income, and a corresponding expense is charged for the discount value. This type
                    of discount is best used for discounts that are promotional in nature, and need
                    to be tracked as a business expense. The COS account can be selected from the
                    drop down list. One default COS account exists in onCourse called 'Discounts
                    Given' but you can create additional COS accounts in the Account settings if you
                    wish to segment your COS options further.</para>
                <para>Discounts which are not linked to a COS account reduce the income value posted
                    to the general ledger. This is the preferred method for recording discount types
                    which are about recognising different fee structures that may exist for
                    different types of students, like overseas CRICOS students vs onshore students,
                    and government funded students.</para>
                <para>The default forecast take-up can be set here, or set individually in the classes
                    you have linked the discount to. This is a prediction that will assist you in your
                    income budgeting, based on the percentage of students you expect to utilise this
                    discount for each class, and therefore the potential cost of providing this discount
                    to your business.</para>

                <title>Require Promotional Code</title>
                <para>A discount which requires a promotional code needs the code defined here. This
                    promotional code has to be entered along with any other restrictions you may
                    have set for the discount to be accessed, be the enrolment online or via the
                    office.</para>

                <para>Setting a valid to or from date is optional. Many types of discounts don't
                    require a date until you decide to retire the discount by editing it to set a
                    date in the past. You can also set days here that are relative to the starting
                    date of the class, allowing you to create a range of early bird discounts that
                    automatically cut in and out based on how far out from commencement the class
                    is.</para>

                <para>A discount which is 'available via online enrolment' means students enrolling

                    only students who are enrolled via the office, in Quick Enrol have access to the
                    discount. You may have chosen to stop a concession card type being added online,
                    but can make the discount still available online for existing students with the
                    concession type on record.</para><para>From the
                    checkbox option 'Hide discounted price on web' you can choose if this discount
                    displays in your online marketing, or just comes as a 'surprise' during the
                    check out process. How a discount displays on the web is based on if it is
                    available to all students, in which case the normal fee is crossed out and the
                    new fee displayed, or to a subset of students, in which case the fee is
                    displayed in brackets next to the primary fee. Restricting a discount to a
                    subset of students is done on the next tab 'Students'.</para>

            <title>Defining the eligible students</title>
            <para>The second section on the discount edit window allows you to define who can access
                the discount.</para>
            <para>Some types of discount may be available to anyone, meaning any person who enrols
                will automatically have the discount applied. They may also have to supply a
                promotional code, or enrol within a fixed period of time, depending on what you set
                in the first section.</para>
            <para>More often, discounts are restricted to people who meet certain criteria. A
                discount may require the student to meet multiple criteria. For example, in the
                Senior's Discount window below, the student needs to provide a Senior's Card, but
                you may also include one that proves they must be over a certain age as well. For
                this to work effectively, you would need to ensure that the date of birth field was
                set to mandatory for website enrolments, otherwise clients just providing the
                details of their seniors card would not be sufficient to access the discount.</para>
            <para>You can limit the discount to students who have previously enrolled in the same
                course or students with a certain membership status.</para>
            <para>To link concessions or memberships to the discount record, they need to already be
                set up in your onCourse records. See <link xlink:href="concessions.html">the concessions
                    and memberships chapter</link> for more information about how to create a
                concession or membership.</para>
            <para>After defining the students, you can also select if you want this discount shown
                in advertising. By default, discounts will show on the website as part of the class
                advertising details. In some instances you may wish to hide the discount from
                advertising, but still allow people to access the discount online, for example, when
                providing an internal staff discount.</para>

        <para>A discount scheme may allow for a 15% discount across a range of classes. If, for one
            of these classes, you want the discount to be 20% instead, you can override the discount
            at the class level. Open a class that has the discount linked to it, go to the Budget
            section, then double click on the discount line.</para>
        <para>When you first view the override screen, you will see the discount scheme converted
            from a percentage (if it was one), to a dollar value. In this example, you can see the
            15% discount has been calculated to be a $37.50 discount on this class.</para>

        <para>To override the discount, click on the unlock icon next to the dollar value and enter

            the discount scheme. When it has been manually overridden, this icon changes to be
            unlocked.</para>
        <para>You can see in the example below when the discount is manually overridden to $40.00,
            the GST calculation also changes. This is because the GST value must be charged on the
            class fee, and as the discount changes, the class fee changes. </para>
        <para>On occasion, to meet the rules of your discount scheme e.g. round to the nearest whole
            dollar, a rounding figure may also be calculated to bring your total to the value you

            <title>Example of how to create custom discounts for Smart and Skilled fees</title>
            <para>Under Smart and Skilled, you may have five or more price points available. The fee
                a student is charged depends on them meeting various eligibility criteria.</para>
            <para>onCourse provides a range of tools for setting up the various fees using discount
                strategies, and then ensuring all students are automatically charged the right fee
                based on their eligibility.</para>
            <para>In onCourse, we recommend you set the most common fee type as the class fee for
                all your Smart and Skilled classes. You can then create various types of discounts
                that either increase or decrease this fee to reflect the other student fee rates
                that may apply.</para>
            <para>In this example, we assume most students enrolling at the college are eligible for
                the 'First Qualification' pricing, so the college will set these fees as the
                standard class fee for each class in the budget section. This will be the fee that
                applies to students enrolling by default, unless another fee type is
                selected.</para>
            <para>In this example, the college offers three Smart and Skilled courses with the
                following prices:</para>

            <para>Steps to
                creating the discounts</para>
            <para>To begin, create a range of Concession types in your onCourse preferences for each
                of the other student fee types. Call them something like 'S&amp;S full fee',
                'S&amp;S 1st qual', 'S&amp;S 2nd qual', 'S&amp;S trainee', 'S&amp;S concession'.
                These concession types will be added to the student as their eligibility is
                assessed, and then used to determine their fee type.</para>
            <para>Because these discounts are really an indication of a class fee pricing scheme,
                rather than a promotional style discount, it is advised from a financial perspective
                to create each of these discount types as NOT being posted to a discount COS, so the
                income value of the class will instead be reduced (or increased) as
                necessary.</para>
            <para>Think of each fee that isn't the First Qual rate as an offset of that value. The
                Full Fee and Second Qual rates require negative discounts (or surcharges) while the
                Traineeship and Concession fees require discounts. Each type of price will require
                it's own discount strategy. This will allow you to report, for each class, on how
                many students enrolled at each price point using the standard discount
                reports.</para>
            <para>A discount type called S&amp;S Full Fee could be created that applies to all smart
                and skilled classes with a discount dollar value of -$3900, and that applies to
                students with the concession type S&amp;S full fee on their record. This amount will
                make the Full Fee price for Certificate III in Community Services correct, but the
                other two classes will need the fee further increased.</para>
            <para>After saving the discount type, open the Certificate III in Early Childhood
                Education and Care class, double click on the S&amp;S Full fee discount in the
                budget section, and override the -$3900 fee to -$4950 to bring the total to $6540.
                Similarly, the S&amp;S Full Fee for Certificate III in Permaculture discount would
                be overridden to -$5210.</para>
            <para>Repeat these steps for each of the discount types for S&amp;S Second Qual, S&amp;S
                Traineeships and S&amp;S Concession fees.</para>
            <para>For the Full Fee to apply during the enrolment process, the student will need to
                have the concession type 'S&amp;S full fee' attached to their contact record. This
                will then automatically select the right price for the class they are enrolling
                into.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Negative Discounts</title>
        <para>Along with being able to create discounts that can help reduce the fee of an enrolment
            or product. You can also create negative discounts (i.e. a surcharge for companies
            booking now, paying later) in both discount schemes and manual discounts. This means the
            increased fee is part of the enrolment invoice line, so the full fee charged will be
            reversed should the enrolment be cancelled.</para>
        <para>Creating a negative discount works just the same way as when you create positive
            discount with the only difference being is you would make the 'Discount value' a
            negative value.</para>
        <para>Discounts with a negative value always supersede discounts of a positive value, so if
            a student is simultaneously eligible for a discount and a surcharge on enrolment, only
            the surcharge will be applied.</para>

        <para>Depending on the discount settings, discounts can be made available to students
            enrolling through the web and office, or just for students enrolling through the
            office.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Accessing discounts through Quick Enrol</title>
            <para>If the student and their chosen class meet the requirements of the discount, it
                will be applied by default on enrolment. If the student is eligible for multiple
                discount types, the discount that provides the lowest cost to the student will be
                applied.</para>
            <para>The reverse is true for negative discounts - if a student is eligible for multiple
                surcharges, then the highest cost to the student will be applied.</para>
            <para>During the enrolment process, discounts that require a promotional code can have
                the code entered on the payment screen. Again, any eligible classes will have their
                fee reduced.</para>
            <para>You can also manually adjust the class fee as necessary by unlocking the price and
                overriding it to a price of your choice. When you choose to override the price, the
                discount selection will change to 'no discount' and your price will become
                adjustable. This means that for reporting purposes, you have created a manual
                discount that will reduce the class income, rather than a discount linked to a
                scheme that may or may not have posted the expense to a COS account.</para>
            <para>You can also override the class fee for any student without a discount to apply a
                new fee altogether. Again, this new fee will not charge anything to a COS account,
                just change the income earnt by the class. Any manual changes will auto adjust the
                tax payable based on the new class fee.</para>

            <para>If you have attached a negative discount to a class then the total fee is
                increased by the amount of the surcharge. In the example below enrolling Jenny Smith
                in the class Woodwork (WDWK-41) incurs a surcharge to pay an admin fee. This fee
                could be charged because you are trying to encourage students to enrol online rather
                than taking up a staff members time on the phone to manually enrol them through

                where discounts apply, or purchases a membership during the enrolment process, the
                best applicable discount will automatically apply.</para>
            <para>For example, if you have created a discount policy for members and friends to
                access two different class prices - members with a 30% discount and friends of
                members with a 10% discount, members who are friends with other members will always

                membership in the general tab of their contact record. This is also the tab that
                loads by default when you add a contact to the Quick Enrol process.</para>
            <para>If your discount policy so allows, and a student is related to a contact who holds
                a membership, you will not see a membership recorded in the relation's record. You
                can see the details of their relationships, however.</para>
            <para>For example, memberships are often sold to corporate partners. In onCourse, these
                contacts are 'companies', and companies can not enrol in classes as they are not
                real people. Employees of companies can enrol, so you may like to set up the
                discount policy so the discount applies to member and their employees.</para>
            <para>If an employee of the membership enrols, and the relationship is noted in their

                booking charge.</para>
            <para>You also have the ability to apply negative discount to an enrolment by increasing
                the class fee. This could be used if you want to charge a student a small booking
                fee for you to enrol them through the office, rather than for them to enrol
                themselves online. This means the increased fee is part of the enrolment invoice

                with a dual label on the website. E.g. if both seniors and students are eligible for
                a 10% discount, and have separate discount policies set up, the website will show
                one fee and the hover will show both discount names. This makes the class fee

        <title>Creating effective discount strategies</title>
        <para>The first consideration in creating a discount is how will you use it to help you
            bring in additional enrolments that you would have otherwise not received. </para>
        <para>Consider low income discounts. These are the discounts you think of when you imagine
            children, seniors, disability card holders or unemployed discounts - people who may have
            limited disposable income and for whom the cost of the full course is a deterrent for
            enrolling. These are discounts which can be given either as a percentage of the course
            fee, or as a fixed dollar figure. If you decide to give a percentage discount you can
            also set the minimum and maximum dollar discount which can be given. So you might to
            decide to give 10% off for seniors but cap it at $50 so that $800 course doesn't start
            to be discounted too heavily for you. Or a 2% discount which gives at least $5 off that
            $100 course so it doesn't appear too stingy.</para>
        <para>Another option is to offer early enrolment discounts, as by encouraging people to
            enrol and pay well before class start dates makes resource management easier on the
            college. You could also provide last minute style discounts, to encourage the spare
            seats to be filled or to get a not quite viable class over the line. These discounts
            could be automatically given to all enrolling students, or be restricted to students who
            can provide the matching promotional code.</para>
        <para>For these type of discounts you would set a start and end date, where other types of
            discounts continue indefinitely. onCourse gives you the choice. </para>
        <para>Other types of discounts may be a 'buy one get one free' style of discounts. These
            types of discount apply when the invoice being created during the enrolment process
            meets certain criteria, such as containing 3 enrolments from the list of specified
            class.</para>
        <para>When considering who can access the discount, you might want to restrict it to all
            students who have enrolled in the past, are over a certain age, live in a particular
            suburb or who have certain type of concession card or membership. You aren't locking it
            to the students who currently fit the requirement: any student who later is entered into
            the system with the right age, suburb, concession or membership type will be able to
            obtain that discount. </para>
        <para>Finally, you are able to set the list of classes which may receive the discount. This
            might be every class you run, just your computer courses, or just one course you choose.
            This gives you flexibility to offer discounts where you think they will be appropriate,
            useful and affordable. You may be able to offer lower discounts to outsourced courses
            given your margins or it may not be helpful to offer seniors discounts to pre-natal
            sessions. </para>
        <para>With all this flexibility, you can offer discounts to your students in exactly the way
            you choose. For instance: </para>
        <itemizedlist>

        <para>Generally, concessions apply on a long term basis and are based on your college's fees
            and charges policy. Concessions are automatically applied to fees on enrolment if a

        <para>Discounts play a part in the budget of onCourse and the process of determining if a

            you may also like to include predictive information about the expected take up of a
            discount. Discounts in onCourse are charged to a cost of sale account, rather than
            considered a straight reduction to income collected, as a discount is considered as a

            <para>There are two ways discounts can be set up to behave in your chart of accounts.
                The default value is for all discounts to post as an expense to your chosen COS
                (Cost of Sale) account. </para>
            <para>Alternatively, this option can be unchecked within the discount set up, and the
                discount can simply reduce the income value.</para>
            <para>In the onCourse chart of accounts, a default account called 'Discounts Given' is
                used to record all the COS discounts. You can add additional COS accounts as needed. </para>
            <para>When a student enrols, the diagram below demonstrates how the income and COS
                discounts are posted against the chart of accounts, for an example $300 enrolment

            <para>Item 1: When the student enrols, the income component of the enrolment fee (in

                allocated income account when the class delivery commences. See <link
                    xlink:href="accounting.html">the accounting chapter</link> for more information
                about how and when income transfers occur.</para>
            <para>Item 2: Prior to the invoice being paid, the amount owing is credited to the trade
                debtor account.</para>
            <para>Item 3: The value of the discount is posted to the chosen income account directly.

                enrolment, or later down the track), the deposited funds account, is credited the
                payment amount, and the amount paid debited from the Trade debtor account. There may
                be multiple payments for an invoice, for example a costly class which is paid off
                over time.</para>
            <para>Item 6: When the class commences, the rest of the class income is 'earned', and

            <title>Understanding GST and rounding in discounts</title>
            <para>GST is an Australian Goods and Services Tax, currently set to a flat rate of 10%
                for all applications of the tax. GST often doesn't apply to enrolments in vocational
                classes, but does apply for enrolments in leisure classes. When GST applies to a
                class, it is important to understand that any discount applied to the class fee will
                cause the GST to be recalculated. </para>
            <para>The reason behind this is that GST must be 10% of the product cost you charge to
                the customer. If the ex GST cost of the product sold drops from $300 to $200 due to
                a discount, then the GST charged must also drop from $30 to $20.</para>
            <para>If you have discount policies that apply to groups of classes, including both GST
                inc and GST ex fees, you will notice that the resulting fee payable by the student
                is different, even if a fixed discount amount is given.</para>
            <para>To put it another way, if you have a GST free class costing $300 which has a $100
                discount, the student will be charged a straight $200. A $100 reduction in the fees
                payable by the student has been applied.</para>
            <para>However, if you have a GST inclusive class costing $300 which has a $100 discount,
                the student will end up paying a GST inclusive fee of $190. The student has been
                given an effective discount of $110, instead of $100. Why do students paying GST now
                get a 'better' discount? Because they are now liable to pay less GST.</para>
            <para>In a class fee of $300 incl GST, $272.73 is the fee income. The remaining $27.27
                is not your income - it is GST you are collecting on behalf of the government and
                holding only until the time you reimburse it to them. In onCourse, GST is always
                posted to a liability account, never to your income account. onCourse budgets always
                exclude GST from any profitability calculations.</para>
            <para>As the $100 discount is actually being given on a $272.73 class fee, reducing it
                to $172.73, the GST now must be recalculated on the new fee. The GST of $17.27
                (instead of the previous GST of $27.27 on the standard fee) now brings the total fee
                payable back to $190.</para>
            <para>Obviously, the different end values of the discounts are most obvious when
                comparing the same GST exclusive and GST inclusive total fees side by side. If,
                instead like in the first example, your GST inclusive class of $300 was a total cost
                of $330, while your GST free class was just $300, the $100 discount would result in
                total fees of $220 and $200 respectively. The GST paying student still pays 10% more
                for their class than the GST free student does, instead of the unexpected 5% less
                when the discounted GST inc/GST free classes have the same starting fee. </para>
            <para>Rounding is apply to the final price after GST is added on. For example if you
                have a class that costs $115 and their is being a 15% discount applied along with
                being rounded to the nearest $1, then $115 will be divided by 1.1 to take away GST
                which equals $104.54. Then you would apply the 15% on to that which will be $104.54
                x 0.85 = $88.86. Then you have to add the GST back on, so $88.86 x 1.1 = $97.75.
                Then finally you would round this amount to the nearest dollar, so the final cost
                would be $98.</para>
