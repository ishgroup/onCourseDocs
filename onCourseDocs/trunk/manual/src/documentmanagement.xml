    <title>Document Management</title>
    <para>onCourse provides an effortless way to manage your documents. Documents can be uploaded to onCourse and linked
        to Courses, Classes, Enrolments, Contacts, Tutors, Students, Sites and Rooms. Because all documents are version controlled you will never lose any historic information, making RTO compliance easy.</para>
