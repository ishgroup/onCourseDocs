    <para>onCourse provides an effortless way to manage your documents. Documents can be uploaded to onCourse and linked
        to Courses, Classes, Enrolments, Contacts, Tutors, Students, Sites and Rooms. Because all documents are version controlled you will never lose any historic information, making RTO compliance easy.</para>
    <para>Document management in onCourse can be used for lots of purposes:<itemizedlist>

        <para>You can add new documents directly in the edit view from many places in onCourse. For
            example below you can see a Course "Accounting" to which we want to add a picture of a
            duck. To do this click the plus symbol above the attachments area.</para>

        <para>You will now be given a choice to find an existing document or upload a new file.
            Let's say we want to upload that duck picture from your computer. You can either click
            on the 'Select file...' button or drag-and-drop the file onto the box below that says

        <para>Once a file has been selected it will take you to another window that you can start

        <para>There are a number of fields when adding a new document, they are:</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Adding a tag to this document can be done by clicking on the tag icon on the left side
            of the sheet.</para>
        <para>You can also choose whether duck is allowed to be attached to other records. If you
            select this option it will appear in the clairvoyance name lookup when you are trying to
            attach an existing document to another record.</para>
        <para>For attachments like contact profile pictures, you may choose not to allow them to be
            attached to other records.</para>
        <para> Below this there are radio buttons which let you state whether duck is attached to
            course ABC or whether it will get attached to all current/future classes for course ABC.
            You will only see this option if you are attaching a resource at the course level.
            Sometimes you'll have a resource which relates to course advertising, or a shared
            resource for all students and tutors in all classes from this course, like an assessment
            submission form.</para>
        <para>However, if you are attaching a resource like a new assessment task that is to be
            distributed to students enrolled in the class, and may change from class to class from
            the course, you can select the second option and attach it to the current and future
            classes from the course, without making it available to students previously enrolled in
            classes from this course.</para>
        <para>If you choose to attach the document to the class, but you began this process in the
            course record, when you complete and close the attachment sheets, you will not see the
            attachment listed in the course attachments as above. Instead, it will be visible in the
            class attachment lists where it has been applied.</para>

            open. To find an existing document, named duck, to course ABC you would start typing the
            name duck in the clairvoyance field on the left side of the sheet. A list will then
            appear with all existing documents in onCourse that contain the word duck in them. If

            You will be given the opportunity to find the file you wish to upload and replace the

                        a new version of an assessment task, for example, you would freeze the

        <para>When you upload a new version of a document to certain record types you will have the
            choice to freeze the previous version to past/completed, current/in progress, and future
            classes or enrolments.</para>

    <section xml:id="documentManagement-specialDocuments">
        <title>Special documents</title>
        <para>Some parts of onCourse have special handling of documents. At the moment the only publicly visible
            example of this is the contact picture. If you open a contact record (company, tutor, student) in edit
            view double click on the image at the top left, you can add your own photo of that person.
            A file dialog will appear and you will be able to choose a photo to add. It will be automatically
            resized to a thumbnail size before being stored.</para>

    <section xml:id="documentManagement-accessRights">
        <title>Access rights</title>
        <para>Each document can have one of several levels of access:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Public - This gives everyone access to the document and will appear on
                        your onCourse public website, as part of the sales and marketing material.
                        When you open this document from inside onCourse, you can send the URL link
                        for these documents to other users and they will open the attachment in a
                        browser.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Private - This means this document will not replicate to the website or
                        the skillsOnCourse portal. It will only be available to administrative users
                        of the onCourse software. While a private document will open in a broswer
                        should you click on the link inside onCourse, this URL contains an access
                        key ID and an expiry period. Should you send this URL to another person,
                        they will receive an 'access denied' message if they try to open it. A
                        private document can only be viewed via the link to it inside the onCourse
                        application.</para>

                        portals.</para>

                        an access key ID and an expiry period. Should you send this URL to another
                        person, they will receive an 'access denied' message if they try to open it. </para>
                    <para>You can send the class tutor or an enrolled student a link to the document
                        inside the portal to allow them to access it e.g.
                        https://www.skillsoncourse.com.au/portal/resources to access all their
                        resources, or https://www.skillsoncourse.com.au/portal/class/5040367 to
                        access the resources attached to a specific class, where 5040367 is the
