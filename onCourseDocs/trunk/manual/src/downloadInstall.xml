	<para>You will need to download two applications: onCourse Client and onCourse Server. The Server
		application manages your data and the Client application allows you to log in, edit and view
		your data. You only need one onCourse Server application running, and onCourse Client
		installed on every workstation which needs access. </para>
	<tip>
		<para>There are no limits to the number of clients you connect to your server. There is no
			'single-user' version of onCourse, but you can run the server and client on the same
			machine.</para>

		<para>The actual operating system configuration is largely irrelevant to onCourse. onCourse will
			not run any better or worse on a 'server' operating system. Use any operating system you
			feel comfortable in supporting.</para>
		<para>onCourse Client requires a minimum of 512Mb of free RAM to run. onCourse Server will run
			in 1024Mb of RAM, however we recommend 1.5Gb as a minimum and more RAM is beneficial for the
			Server application in larger installations. Note that if you are running a 32bit operating
			system you are limited to 1.5Gb and we recommend running onCourse Server on a 64bit operating
			system. Note that the above RAM requirements are the RAM needed for onCourse itself; you
			require more RAM to run other applications and the operating system itself.</para>

		<title>Cloud hosted</title>
		<para>If ish is provided a hosted server either on your premises or in our data centre, you can
				launch onCourse in two ways. The first is a installable client application which
				requires Windows 7 or above, or OSX 10.7 or above. The second is a URL link which
				will work if you have Java 8,9 or 10 installed. Java 11 and above will not work with
				this approach.</para>
	</section>
	<section xml:id="downloadinstall-Virtualisation">
		<title>Virtualisation</title>
		<para>onCourse will run perfectly fine in a virtualised environment such as VMWare. Ensure that
			you have sufficient RAM and CPU allocated to onCourse and consult your VMWare expert for
			tuning. onCourse Client will rarely write to disk and onCourse Server only writes log files to
			disk unless you are using the built-in database option.</para>
		<para>Many colleges choose to run onCourse Client under Terminal Services. This is a good option
			if you use Terminal Services to manage your client deployment and can give you better
			performance if your client workstations are at the other end of a slow network link.</para>
	</section>
		<section xml:id="downloadinstall-Database">
			<title>Database considerations</title>
			<para>onCourse Server can be used with its built-in database, or for larger
				installations with an external database. You can choose between the following
				databases:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Built-in</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>MySql (minimum version 5.5)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>MariaDB (minimum version 10.0)</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Most users should choose the built-in database option as it is by far the simplest
				and performs very well even for databases of over 100,000 students and a dozen
				simultaneous users.</para>
			<caution>
				<para>If you use the built-in database, make sure that you put your data file on a
					disk connected directly to the computer onCourse Server is running on. That is,
					do NOT put the data file on a disk which is shared over the network (eg. on a
					NAS device or file server).</para>

		<para>How to install a new version of onCourse</para>
		<section>
			<title>What is an onCourse upgrade?</title>
			<para>Periodically, ish release new versions of the onCourse client and server software. These
				new releases may include new features, new reports or important fixes from previous version. </para>
			<para>When we release a new version we also publish release notes outlining the changes we have
				made. All onCourse releases or product updates are available freely to download for
				all users on both paid and free plans. We will send a message to all users on our
				onCourse mailing list and also publish information about the release on our blog. </para>
			<para>Users can choose how and when to upgrade their business software. Both the server and
				client software will need to be upgraded, meaning that you will not be able to
				access your onCourse database during the upgrade process. Usually this will take
				less than 10 minutes. Your onCourse website will continue to function and take
				enrolments during the upgrade process.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Backing up your onCourse datafile</title>
			<para>All the important customer and business information you have entered into onCourse is
				stored in a file called onCourse.iocdata on your server machine. When you first installed
				onCourse you would have specified the location for this file, but if you can't remember
				where you saved it you can search your machine for this file. The file may appear as a
				folder on some operating systems. </para>
			<para>This file is very important. As a general rule, you should ensure you have set the
				internal onCourse backup process to run daily. You then should ensure that the backup file
				is copied to an offsite storage location, like a remote server in another office or taken
				offsite daily on a USB or tape drive.</para>
			<para> In addition to this automatic backup process, you can also manually backup onCourse
				prior to running an upgrade. To do this you need to first make sure all your users have
				logged out of onCourse client and that you have shut down the onCourse server software (or
				stopped the onCourse service if running as a service on a Windows machine). </para>
			<para>1. Shut down the onCourse server </para>
			<para>2. Locate the onCourse.iocdata file </para>
			<para>3. Make a copy of the onCourse.iocdata file and save it in another folder or drive </para>
			<para>4. Rename the copied onCourse.iocdata file something like
				onCourse.manualbackup1-3-10</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Upgrading the onCourse datafile</title>
			<para>Now you have made a backup of your most recent datafile you are ready to upgrade your
				database.</para>
			<para> To upgrade, you first need to have downloaded the most recent onCourse server
				software</para>
			<para>Run the downloaded install package and install the new version of the onCourse server in
				the same location as the previous copy of the onCourse server. This will overwrite the
				server software. </para>
			<para>When you run the new copy of the server software it will automatically upgrade your
				onCourse data to the latest version. This process may take up some time if significant
				changes were made or if you are upgrading from a much older version. </para>
			<para>Please contact us with a copy of your onCourseServer.log file if during this process you
				get a message that the upgrade process has failed.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Upgrading the onCourse clients</title>
			<para>On all machines where your users access onCourse, you will need to make sure that the
				local copy of the onCourse client software is upgraded. </para>
			<para>If an older version of the client attempts to access the server, it will be unsuccessful
				and get a message about the server being a newer version. </para>
			<para>To upgrade the clients, ensure you downloaded the most recent onCourse client
				software</para>
			<para>Run the downloaded install package and install the new version of the onCourse client in
				the same location as the previous copy of the onCourse client on each machine. This will
				overwrite the client software. </para>
			<para>Ensure the server software is back up and running before attempting to log in the new
				client. All user names and passwords will stay the same as prior to the upgrade.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Can I downgrade my onCourse software?</title>
			<para>No, after you have upgraded you can not then downgrade your onCourse data file. This is
				because structural changes will have been made as part of any upgrade process which means
				the data is no longer compatible with the previous version.</para>
			<para> If you need to downgrade or run a previous version of onCourse for any reason, you can
				use the manual backup file you made prior to upgrade. Please note that any new data you have
				entered after the upgrade will not be available from your backup. You can request copies of
				previous versions of the onCourse software installation files from ish at any time.</para>

			<title>Running multiple versions of the onCourse Server</title>
			<para>If you have an onCourse website it is very important that you never run two copies of
				your onCourse datafile simultaneously or attempt to revert to an onCourse backup without
				contacting ish first. We can ensure your backup datafile does not try to override your
				website data when you run it. This includes customers who wish to run a test or training

					<para>The mechanism within onCourse that is utilised by our clients with an onCourse managed
						webservice is also used to poll our webserver periodically for any changes
						to the TGA data, including customers using the free onCourse community
						version, to ensure you have the latest version of the data (and also to save
						us packaging this data within our application download - the first time your
						sever connects you will have downloaded the 52,000 odd unit of competency
						records) </para>
					<para>Your server makes a connection once a day to https://oncourse-replicate.ish.com.au on
						port 443. If this port is blocked by your firewall, you won't be able to
						access any of the TGA data updates. Make sure you can visit this URL and
						that the firewall allows traffic.</para>
