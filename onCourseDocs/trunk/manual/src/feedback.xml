    <section>
        <title>Class completion surveys in onCourse</title>
        <para>The onCourse student feedback and survey tool is designed to capture some simple data
            that can be used to track the rating of your courses, venues and tutors over time, by
            rating them out of five. In addition, the students can complete a Net Promoter Score
            (rating out of 10) where they indicate how likely they are to recommend you to a friend
            and provide free-form text feedback you can use to improve your services or publish to
            the website as a testimonial. You can also add additional questions of your own using
            custom fields, or delete any of the default questions should they be unwanted.</para>
        <para>These Surveys can be set to display at set points through out a Course, or triggered
            'on demand' via a custom script. The students complete their survey response in the
            SkillsOnCourse portal, and tutors are able to see a feedback summary in their portal
            also. More detailed views and reports regarding survey completion are available to admin
            users of the onCourse application.</para>

        <title>How to Add Custom Survey Questions</title>
        <para>You can add your own custom questions to the survey by using the Custom Fields
            section. These questions will not use the same format as the default questions and don't
            display the Stars to respond with, instead adding a free text field for users to type
            their answers in, or a drop down menu with pre-entered answers you can set when creating
            the field. To add a question:<itemizedlist>

        <title>Requesting Feedback from Students</title>
        <para>You can now request feedback from students at different points during a course: <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">On Enrolment</emphasis> - This will make the survey
                        available to students upon enrolment into a course</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">On Start</emphasis> - This will make the survey
                        available from midnight the day the class begins</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Midway</emphasis> - This will make the survey
                        available from midnight closest to the middle between the start and end
                        dates</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">At Completion</emphasis> - This will make the survey
                        available from the moment the last session of the class is completed</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">On Demand</emphasis> - This setting will require a
                        custom script to define the time's at which this survey will be sent to
                        student's to fill out.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>There are two default scripts and associated templates available as standard to
            communicate survey completion requests to students. These can be modified as required to
            suit your business requirements. More information about onCourse customising scripts can
            be found in <xref linkend="scripts"/></para>
        <para>'Send Certificate created notification' and 'Send class completion survey' both send a
            loginless link using the parameter ${enrolment.student.getPortalLink(enrolment)}. This
            link has a default time-to-live of 7 days, meaning that if the user clicks the link in
            the email within 7 days of it being sent, they can complete the feedback survey without
            logging in. You can extend the time to live by adding an additional parameter e.g.
            ${enrolment.student.getPortalLink(enrolment, 30)} means the link lasts for 30 days
            before login is required.</para>
        <para>By default the scripts trigger the day after the final class session, allowing you to
            collect feedback as soon as practical after the event is over, however if you change
            this setting within the form, it will send at the corrected time.</para>

        <title>Completing the survey - Student Portal View</title>
        <para>When the student clicks on the survey link in a email, they are taken directly to the
            class page where they can see their attendance results and click on the feedback link to
            complete the survey. By default the feedback link shows as five unfilled stars if the
            student has not yet provided a response.</para>

            </caption>
        </mediaobject>
        <para>When the student clicks on the Feedback stars, the Survey element expands. The
            response to the first question displayed 'How likely are you to recommend us to a
            friend', also known as a Net Promoter Score, determines the text that appears in the
            free text field. If the student provides an NPS of 7 or less, then the field text is
            'Please tell us how we could have improved your experience'. If the NPS is greater than
            7, the label switches to 'What did you most enjoy about your experience'.</para>
        <para>The responses in the >7 range are most likely to be those useful for marketing
            testimonial data, while responses in the =&lt; 7 range will become quality improvement
            opportunities. Best practice recommends you close the loop for Net Promoter Scores of 6
            or less, and actively follow up with the customers who provide negative feedback, using
            it as an opportunity to turn a detractor into a promoter.</para>

        <title>Editing and approving feedback for online testimonial use</title>
        <para>By default, all new feedback responses will be classified as 'Waiting review' so you
            can then review the comment and mark it as 'not testimonial' i.e. it is feedback you
            will use for quality improvement processes or set it to 'public testimonial' to use the
            feedback in your marketing materials. </para>
        <para>When a testimonial is set to 'public testimonial' the comment made by the student is
            copied into the testimonial field, so you can edit it as needed to remove any spelling
            or grammatical errors or remove personally identifying data they may have inadvertently
            included.</para>
        <para>Only feedback set to 'Public testimonial' status will be included in the testimonials
