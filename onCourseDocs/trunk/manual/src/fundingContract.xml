		<title>What are Funding Contracts?</title>
		<para>Funding Contract allows you to connect additional funding to an enrolment. Whether this is
			from a state funding source or private agreement, funding contract allows you to create
			a default payer and payment that will be used to fund all or part of an enrolment. It
			allows you to easily locate a report on one or more funding contract types to your
			funding agency.</para>
		<para>Funding contracts encompass state funding sources linked to Smart and Skilled or CSO, but
			also allows you to set up custom funding contracts. The funding contract can also be
			linked to the AVEMTISS Reporting type required for that contract. </para>
		<para>onCourse has created default templates for the State based funding contracts, and integrated
			them with your AVETMISS reporting options. On higher level subscriptions, you are able
			to create custom funding contracts for any source of funding that supports the student
			enrolment, such as grants, department co-payment or even private contracts with large
			organisation. </para>
