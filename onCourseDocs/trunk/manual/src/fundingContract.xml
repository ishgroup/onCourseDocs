		<title>What are Funding Contracts?</title>
		<para>Funding Contract allow you to connect additional funding to an enrolment. Whether this
			be from a state funding source or private agreement, funding contact allows you to
			create a default payer and payment that will be used to fund all or part of an
			enrolment. </para>
		<para>Funding course encompasses state funding sources link Smart and Skilled or CSO, but
			also provides for you to set up custom funding contract and link them to payers and
			enrolments. The funding contract can also be linked to the AVEMTISS Reporting type
			required for that contract. </para>
		<para>onCourse has created default template for the State based funding contract, and integrated
			them with your reporting and online enrolment process using the Data Collection
			features. On higher level subscriptions, you are able to create custom funding contacts
			for any source of funding that supports the student enrolment, such as grants,
			department co-payment or even private contracts with large organisation. </para>

			<title>Enrolment (NAT00120) File</title>
			<para>This is the biggest and most critical file - all the detail about what students
				have enrolled in and completed and whether or not your going to get payment for it.
				This information comes from a variety of locations in onCourse, so field by field
				we'll cover it here:</para>
			<section>
				<title>Training Organisation Delivery Location Identifier</title>
				<para>This is a numerical reference back to the site you have set up. You can cross
					reference this with the sites reported in the NAT00020 file. If your onCourse
					classes are not linked to a site, or linked to a virtual site, your default
					admin site details will be reported.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Client Identifier</title>
				<para>This is the onCourse student number that was automatically assigned when the
					student record was first created. This number can change over time when you
					merge students. You can cross reference the students in the NAT00080 and
					NAT00085 files. </para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Subject Identifier</title>
				<para>For VET courses, this is the National Code of the associated unit of
					competency. For non-VET courses this is a unique ISH reference number. You can
					see a student's unit and additional outcome data in their student record or in
					their enrolment records. This information is cross referenced with the NAT00060
					file.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Program Identifier</title>
				<para>This is the National Code of the courses related Qualification. This field is
					only populated if you marked the course as a 'is sufficient for a full
					qualification' in onCourse, unless you are exporting in QLD or NSW where it will
					always be exported if you have linked the course to a Qualification. This
					information is cross referenced with the NAT00030 file.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Outcome Identifier - National</title>
				<para>You can set the outcome identifier (we call it status) on the Outcomes tab in
					the Class window. If you select all the records in the list and right click on
					them, you can set them all to 'Successful (20)' and then go back and change the
					others that should be other statuses (like RPL or Not Yet Competent) one by one.
					Or you can set them all one by one, whichever you prefer. You can also set the
					outcome status in the student contact record or the enrolment record.</para>
				<para>If you set an outcome an RPL, RCC or Credit Transfer status, the Delivery Mode
					Identifier will always export as 90 - NA regardless of what is set in the
					outcome value.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Scheduled Hours</title>
				<para>The scheduled hours reported are the nominal hours that you set in the unit of
					competency. If you added the nominal hours when setting up the course it will
					report here. You can override the Scheduled Hours in the individual
					outcome.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Funding Source - National</title>
				<para>You preferred default setting can be set on the general preferences Class
					Defaults tab. This can be changed for each Class on the VET tab. You can also
					change it for each outcome in the class Outcomes tab or for each student in
					their Enrolment record on the General tab. Double click the outcome to see this
					field.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Commencing Program Identifier</title>
				<para>If the student was enrolled in a class linked to a course marked as a full
					qualification, then we output the value 3 - Commencing enrolment in a
					qualification or course. If the enrolment was not linked to a course marked as a
					full qualification, then this will export as 8 - Unit of competency or module
					only enrolment.</para>

			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Client Tuition Fee</title>
				<para>This is the fee you charged the student at the time of enrolment, divided by
					the total nominal hours in the course, multiplied by the nominal hours of each
					unit to set a proportional student fee for each unit. To charge a fee, set a
					class fee in the Class General tab. VET courses are usually GST exempt. During
					the enrolment process, you can charge the student the full fee or give them a
					manual discount if they meet fee exemption criteria. The fee they pay here is
					what is reported. If you don't usually use onCourse for invoicing and payment
					records, create a full cash payment for each student on enrolment. Don't worry
					about the invoices that are automatically created here - they have nothing to do
					with AVETMISS.</para>

				<title>NSW OLiV reporting</title>
				<para>AVETMISS reporting via OLiV is required for Adult and Community Education customers who
					receive funding under the ACE Provider Contract to deliver the Adult and
					Community Education Community Service Obligation Program (ACE CSO Program)
					and/or the Tech Savvy Seniors (TSS) program.</para>
				<para>Although this program is a subset of the NSW Smart &amp; Skilled program it is not
					reported via the usual STSOnline portal. ACE colleges are also expected to lodge
					the entirety of their training data for total VET Activity reporting via OLiV,
					where it will be collated and sent to NCVER as a sector wide report. Non-VET
					training activity data can also be lodged via OLiV and it is encouraged that ACE
					providers to so.</para>
				<para>State specific funded training (e.g. Smart &amp; Skilled) must also be
					reported via the State Training Service portal for that state. Reporting this
					data via OLiV does not exclude you from your reporting requirements for other
					contracts.</para>
				<para>Customers reporting in NSW using the OLiV portal are advised to choose this export option
					in the AVETMISS export process. This export option includes the standard below
					the line fields.</para>
				<para>Outcomes code Did Not Start - 66 will export a 66 code if reporting in OLiV

				<title>NSW Smart and Skilled (for 2015 onwards data)</title>
				<para>This export option is for reporting Smart &amp; Skilled funded training in NSW
					and meets the requirements of the <link xlink:href="https://www.ish.com.au/sites/ish.com.au/files/NOV2015_e-reporting_tech_specs.pdf">Smart and Skilled eReporting Technical Specifications and Business
						Validations Version 1.3 November 2015 specifications.</link></para>
				<para>The 'Outcome identifier - Training Organisation' field has been added to the
					Enrolment general tab to record the possible Training not completed (TNC) or
					Training Deferred (D) value for the enrolment.</para> 
				<para>After changing the Enrolment to TNC, you will need to go to the outcomes change them all
					to 'Did Not Start'. </para>
				<para>NOTE: Smart &amp; Skilled flavour exports will convert any outcome marked as
					Did not Start - 66 as two blank spaces  for reporting. Did not Start - 66 is not
					a valid outcome code for Smart &amp; Skilled reporting. Outcomes code Did Not
					Start - 66 will only export a 66 as the code if reporting in OLiV Flavour. </para>
				<para>Once you have reported this enrolment, and had it accepted by State Training Services, you
					may wish to suppress it from future AVETMISS exports. If this is the case, on
					the general tab of the enrolment select the option 'Do not report for
					AVETMISS'.</para>
				<para>The field Purchasing Contract Identifier, which previously existed at the
					class level has also been added to the enrolment general tab, with the NSW
					specific label of Commitment ID. All outcomes in an enrolment will be reported
					with the same Commitment ID.</para>
				<para>The field Funding Source - State Training Authority field which was previously
					available at the class and outcome level has also been added to the enrolment

				<para>At the point in time the Smart &amp; Skilled export is run, any outcomes
					selected with a start date in the future will export with a two blank spaces in
					the place of the outcome identifier - national, regardless of what has been set
					in the database or in the export runner preferences. i.e. you can choose the
					option 'export 90 - not yet available for VET outcomes which are not set' and
					the Smart &amp; Skilled override for the two blank spaces will still apply where
					appropriate.</para>
				<para>An email address for all Smart &amp; Skilled students is mandatory. If the

				<title>NSW DET - APL (for 2014 data or earlier)</title>
				<para>This export option is for reporting to the NSW Training Market and meets the
					requirements of the ePayments Factsheet 4.3 - March 2014 Data Specifications.
					This means you will export blank spaces for the outcome where the outcome has
					not been set for this option.</para>
				<para>NSW has three special NSW only 'below the line' fields that are used in
					reporting. They are the Booking ID (NAT00120 position 143), Course Site ID
					(NAT00120 position 153) and Training Plan developed (NAT00120 position 163). The
					first two fields can be found in the class VET tab, with the Training Plan
					developed field located on the enrolment general tab.</para>
				<para>When reporting, the way your data is set up will determine if the export will
					trigger an initial, midway or final payment.</para>
				<para>An initial payment will be triggered the first time you lodge the data for a
					new student and course combination. Usually you would report some or all of the
					units of competency that the student will be completing during the course, but
					with no outcome status.</para>
				<para>NSW also likes to see that the start and end dates of the various units in the
					course are not all the same i.e. they do not all start and end on the same day.
					We recommend you use the training plan feature in the class timetable to vary
					the start and end dates across the course duration.</para>
				<para>A midway payment is determined when you show progress in the course. This
					could be because you have enrolled the student in additional units of
					competency, or because the student has achieved an outcome for some of the units
					of competency you reported in the initial lodgement.</para>
				<para>If you try to report after the initial, a changed status where all the units
					have an outcome, this will trigger the midway and final payment in one
					action.</para>
				<para>Keep in mind that you will always get an error if you try to report a
					student's final outcome status prior to the outcome end date. If you do have a
					final status you wish to report, then change the outcome end date to a date
					prior the day you want to lodge the data.</para>
				<para>The special difference between a midway and final payment is the generation of
					the NAT00130 (course completion) record. onCourse generates this automatically,
					you don't need to set anything in the student's record.</para>
				<para>The NAT00130 record file is created to indicate the student's enrolment is
					completed. There is a record created for this file either because all their
					outcomes from the class are set and all the outcome end dates are before the end
					date of the export specified. If all of the outcomes have a successful status
					(e.g. competent, RPL granted, credit transfer ect) and the enrolment was in a
					class linked to a course marked as 'satisfies requirement for a complete
					qualification' then the NAT00130 will have a Y, for a successful course
					completion. If any of the outcomes have an unsuccessful status (e.g. withdrawn,
					not yet competent, did not start) for a full qualification enrolment, or the
					enrolment was in a short course then the NAT00130 will output a N for
					non-qualification completion.</para>
				<para>If you are doing a final export you must ensure you choose an end date before
					the day of export but after the last end date of the outcomes when exporting -
					initial and midway exports don't need the outcome start and end dates
					specified.</para>

		<title>Validating and correcting AVETMISS errors</title>
		<para>Prior to exporting your AVETMISS data, you may wish to run some reports inside
			onCourse to check the values you have set. These reports can also be useful
			organisational data for other reporting and segmenting of your VET delivery.</para>
		<para>From the classes window, two CSV exports are available. CSV files can be opened in
			Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet applications. If you ever wished you could easily
			open and read NAT00120 files in Excel, consider this the next best thing.</para>
		<para>Begin by opening the classes window and locating the classes you wish to export,
			through the usual sorts, searches and filters. Once you have located and highlighted the
			classes in the list view choose File > Import/Export > Export Classes</para>
		<para>From the export format list options, choose either 'class outcomes CSV report' or
			'extended outcomes CSV'.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Class Outcomes CSV</title>
			<para>The purpose of this export is to show you all the outcomes and the outcome status
				of the enrolments associated with the classes you've exported. This can be a useful
				way to locate outcomes where the end date has passed but a final result has not yet
				been entered into onCourse.</para>
			<para>This report contains the onCourse student number, student first and last name,
				course-class code, unit of competency code and name, outcome start and end date and
				outcome status.</para>
			<para>Keep in mind this report is showing you the actual data in the onCourse records -
				when you export actual AVETMISS data from onCourse, the export runner values will
				set outcome status 90 for outcomes in progress, and outcome status 70 for outcomes
				that end in future calendar years. The value inside the database will remain as not
				set.</para>

			Response to common questions will be added here also.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Where do I enter the State Funding Codes in onCourse for the state where I am
				reporting to?</title>
			<para>There are two places where you can set your State Funding Source codes. The first
				in on the VET tab of the class. This is a useful place to set the code when all (or
				most) of the students in the class have the same funding source applying to
				them.</para>
			<para>First you will need to make sure you have an up to date list of the appropriate
				State Funding Codes to use within your reporting state. onCourse doesn't maintain a
				list of these codes, you will need to contact your local reporting officer to obtain
				this information.</para>

				</imageobject>
				<caption>
					<para>Enter your State Funding Source code in the field highlighted.</para>
				</caption>
			</mediaobject>
			<para>If a student has a different funding code which applies to them, you can just
				change their enrolment funding codes to make it different to the one set at the
				class level. If all students in the class have different funding codes, you don't
				need to set anything at the class level, but can set each outcome separately on the
				enrolment general tab. </para>
			<para>Where the value populates from a record level above, you will see the value in the
				lower level record with the lock icon. In this case, it means the enrolment is
				inheriting the value from the level above, the class. You can click the unlock icon
				to change the value and break the inherited linked value from the class.</para>

			<title>How do I record information about a clients traineeship?</title>
			<para>When a student is completing a traineeship, you will have been given a 'Training
				Contract Identifier' and a Client 'Identifier' by your state funding body. They may
				call them by different names, but the important thing to confirm is that they are
				the data that exports into the NAT000120 in positions 70 &amp; 80
				respectively.</para>
			<para>This data is entered into the onCourse enrolment window. This data will need to be
				entered after enrolment by going to the Enrolment window, locating the student's
				enrolment record and double clicking on it. On the general tab you will find these
				fields.</para>
			<para>In NSW, you will need to put your Training Contract ID into BOTH of these fields,
				as NSW doesn't issue a separate Client Identifier for trainees.</para>
			<para>If you have broken the traineeship into multiple enrolments, each with one or more
				units of competency, you will need to enter this information into each enrolment
				record for the student that relates to the traineeship. This information is not
				recorded as part of the student's master contact record, as the student may also
				have other enrolment records which don't form part of this traineeship.</para>
