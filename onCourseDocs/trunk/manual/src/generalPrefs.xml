		<para>onCourse makes it easy to send emails and SMS to the students and teachers that are listed

			<listitem>
				<para>It is important to configure an outbound mail server in order for email from onCourse to

			<title>Handing bounced emails (VERP)</title>
			<para>VERP - Variable Envelope Return Paths is a feature which automatically handles bounced
				emails from onCourse. When this is enabled, emails are sent out with a special From address
				that looks like "bounces+124673@rosewoodcollege.com.au". The Reply-To address is set
				normally with the standard from address you have defined in "Email from address", so a user
				can reply without any problems. The number after the plus sign is used to identify the
				Contact in onCourse to whom this email was originally sent: this is important because emails
				could be forwarded several times in remote mail systems and the bounce may not come from the
				address you expect.</para>
			<para>This "plus addressing" notation is a standard internet protocol and most mail servers
					support it. You simply define the base email account (e.g.
					"bounces@rosewoodcollege.com.au") and the mail server will ignore the part after
					the plus. </para>

		<title>Maintenance</title>
		<para>The maintenance screen controls how often and where your data is backed up. This feature is
			recommended for users who are not connecting onCourse to an external server such as MySQL or
			SQL Server, as these external servers have their own daily scheduled backup routines. </para>
		<para>With the amount of information you will eventually have stored on your onCourse program,
			the backing up of this data is essential. onCourse is designed to enable you to schedule when
			and where the back ups take place. You can also set onCourse to have an automatic logout. This
			means that if onCourse is left open on the computer but no one is using it, after a specified
			amount of time it will automatically logout and save any recently entered data. </para>
		<para>Prior to setting up your backup schedule, you need to determine which folder location you
			are going to save these backup files to. It is important to ensure that you save the backups
			on a different drive to the one where you have installed your onCourse server, that way if
			your hardware / drives do fail, your backup files are safe. You also need to ensure that you
			create the folders that you have specified in the file path, otherwise the backup files that
			are created will not be able to be found. </para>
		<caution>
			<para>Running an onCourse back up to a location on your server is not the only step you need
				to take to secure your data. You should also make sure that the backup file is saved to an
				offsite location on a regular basis in case of hardware of other physical failure of your
				computer.</para>
		</caution>
		<para>An example file extension for a Mac could be as follows:</para>
		<para>/Users/Shared/</para>
		<para>[Note: the Mac file path uses the Unix system of a forward slash to separate directory and
				file components and make sure you have a forward slash at the front of the file
				path].</para>
		<para>An example file extension for Windows could be as follows:</para>
		<para>C:\onCourse\backups\</para>
		<para>[Note: the Windows backup directory uses a back slash to separate directory and file
			components. It is also recommended that you do not save your backups to your Program File
			folder within Windows as this is not designed for data files].</para>

			<para>Some of the payment methods can't be edited and when you try and do this all the fields

			<title>Concession Types</title>
			<para>Navigate here by clicking on 'File' -> 'Preferences' -> 'General' from the top
				menu, then click on the Concession Types option.</para>
				<para>Some concession types may be available for your students to add to their own record
					during the online enrolment process, for example a Senior's Card. Other types you may
					want to restrict to only allowing the concession to be added to the student record via
					the onCourse client, for example College Staff. </para>
				<para>If you require an expiry date on the concession type, any discounts that apply to that
					concession type will not be available if the student's concession is expired.</para>
				<para>You may also choose to make entering a card number mandatory. Please note onCourse is
					not able to validate the authenticity of card numbers due. This is an open test field
					(string type) and will accept letters and numbers. This field is useful for ensuring
					that only card holders self identify - you can use this data to conduct random spot
					checks if required.</para>
				<para>Note that when you allow concessions to be added on the website, users must confirm
					they hold a current and valid concession. As we can not perform validation against so
					many external systems, the application for concession online is an honor system. Over
					the years, our customers have reported very low abuse of this method, as in the
					education market clients generally attend classes face to face. Well written enrolment
					policies ensure that if a client can not present in person the concession type they have
					claimed, then they will be billed for the full course fee.</para>

			<para>A special, non-editable relationship for 'Parent or Guardian' and 'Child' is used

			<para>A relationship has two sides i.e. parent and child. Some times both sides will

			<para>Navigate here by going to the menu File > Preferences >  General. Click on the Custom
				fields option in the left hand panel. To add a new custom field click on the 'Add
				new custom field' button.</para>
			<para>Custom fields are available for Contact, Course, Enrolment, Application and Waiting List.
				You can rearrange how the custom fields you create are ordered on this page by
				clicking on the grouped dots icon to the left of a custom field, then dragging it up
				or down to change the order.</para>
			<para>Before you add a custom field to the database, consider how and when it will be
				used and which would be the best record type (entity) to link the custom field
				to.</para>
			<para>For example, information you would only ask the student once that will stay near to the
				same over time belongs in the contact record, like the person's Driver's Licence, or
				alternate email address. Information that is specific to a particular enrolment or
				application process belongs in those records, for example, meal selection for a
				conference or application data collected for approval for a funded program.</para>

			</mediaobject>
			<para>All custom fields are searchable. This allows you to create fields for, and record
				information, that is particular to your business. Custom fields can be made
				mandatory, but that means every contact in your database needs to complete the field
				before the record can be saved. Often the better choice is to make the completion
				mandatory on the form or forms where it applies. You can add as many additional
				fields as you need to, and they will display in the records in the order they have
				been added. </para>
			<para>Each custom field has a key which is the code that is used to reference the custom field in
				exports and reports. For example, the custom field in the image below with key
				'howDidYouHearAboutUs' can be referenced as a field in email template as </para>
			<programlisting language="groovy">Thanks for letting us know that ${contact.howDidYouHearAboutUs} was how you heard about us!</programlisting>
			<para>The same custom field can easily be added to exports using it's key also:</para>
			<programlisting language="groovy">"How Did You Hear About Us?"  :  contact.howDidYouHearAboutUs?.value</programlisting>
			<para>Custom fields can be free text fields, have a list of pre-defined choices in a
				drop down list or have a single set default values. If you want to set a list of
				predefined choices, separate each item in the list with a semicolon. If you want to
				include a free choice option at the end of your list, make the final option a star
				character. e.g. Radio; TV; Internet; *</para>
