			<title>The onCourse Dashboard</title>
			<para>The dashboard is the opening window of onCourse; it is the first thing you will
				see on your screen after you successfully login. The dashboard is made up of a
				three-column view window with a quick access column containing two sub-tabs on the
				left (Favourites and All), a latest activity column in the middle, and an enrolments
				&amp; revenue column on the right. There is also a logout button, a button to change
				your visual themes and, in some cases, and an Upgrade to onCourse Pro button for
				anyone using the free version of the software.</para>
			<para>Columns can be resized by hovering your mouse over one of the cut-off lines, then
				clicking and dragging either left or right to decrease or increase the size of the
				column. You can also resize the window by hovering your mouse over the bottom-right
				corner, or the left or bottom edges of the window, then clicking and dragging to
				resize it.</para>

				<title>Favorites</title>
				<para>This column is the best way to gain one-click access to almost all the

					Enrol, however if you click the Edit button it will change to say 'Save' and all
					the windows you can reach from this section will be displayed. If you hover your
					mouse, you'll see a heart icon appear next to it. Click it to add that window to
					your Favorites window, and click it again to remove it. Click 'Save' to save

					revenue, as well as a breakdown of the number of courses you have set up in the
					system.</para>
				<para>The course breakdown will show you the last courses enrolled in, the courses

			<para>onCourse's list views appear when you open a window. For example, if you click on

				classes that are complete or cancelled. In the header bar of the window you will see
				how many records are displaying in the list based on any filters or search options
				running e.g. Classes (38 shown of 267).</para>

			<para>To delete a record, highlight the record you want to remove, click on the remove
				button and the record will be deleted. Some records in onCourse can not be deleted
				because they have formed relationships with other onCourse records, and it doesn't
				make sense to be allowed to delete half of a record relationship. E.G. if you try to
				delete a class with one or more enrolments in it (even if those enrolments have been
				cancelled), you will get a message like the one below. In this instance, you would
				need to cancel the class instead of deleting it.</para>

		<title>Cogwheel special functions</title>
		<para>The cogwheel is a powerful and very useful tool in onCourse, as it can execute a range

			manually. </para>
		<para>The cogwheel appears on most screens in onCourse, and the options that appear under it
			will largely be contextual to the screen you're viewing. You can manually execute
			scripts, duplicate classes and courses, send messages to contacts, add or remove classes

		<para>To use the cogwheel, highlight a record on the window you're viewing, then click the
			cogwheel icon to see your options.</para>
	</section>
	<section xml:id="gettingStarted-recordView">
		<title>Record detail view</title>
		<para>The onCourse record view appears once you open (double-click) on a record in a list
			view. It is how you edit things like contacts, courses, classes etc and contains tab
			groups. Depending on the records you're viewing, the information displayed and how its
			shown can vary a lot.</para>
		<para>To see a record view, go to a window like "class" and double click on a record in the
			list view. The screenshot below shows you what to expect in a typical class record view,
			remembering this varies depending on what kind of window you are in. All windows are
			laid out similarly in onCourse, with tabs to group related data and navigate inside the
			record.</para>

		</mediaobject>
		<para>But the class record view alone is not enough to get an idea of how tabs work,
			throughout this documentation, there are detailed explanations of what each record view
			tab means, for example see the <link xlink:href="classes.html">Classes chapter</link> to
			learn about class record view tabs in detail, or see the <link
				xlink:href="tutors.html#tutors-recordTabs">Tutors chapter</link> to learn about
			tutor record view tabs.</para>
		<para>In a record view, you will see these buttons on the bottom:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Next: If you press this, the very next record in the list will load its data
					into the record view, this will basically close the record you were just looking
					at and replace the data with the next record in line. Note that this could take
					a few seconds as it is bringing up a lot of data from the record. It's a faster
					way than closing the current record view and opening another record view. If you
					have made any changes to the record, you will promoted to save before moving
					forwards.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Previous: Like the "next" button, pressing on the previous button will load
					the previous record or the record before the record you are currently viewing.
					You may be prompted to save first.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Cancel: After clicking on this button, you will be asked if you want to
					discard changes or save changes. Discarding means you are not saving you changes
					on closing. This will only occur if you have made any changes, otherwise the
					window will just close.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Save: This button will save your changes to the record and close, it won't ask
					you for anything unlike the "cancel" button. When you close a record view, you
					will returned to your previous list view.</para>

			<title>Open related records</title>
			<para>The open related records icon will appear in carious windows throughout onCourse.
				This little icon is very useful, as it opens the record in a new window. The best
				way to define it is to give you an example of what it is used for:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>If you are confirming class details for a student on the phone, they may
						want to know more about the units of competency assigned to the course. This

			<para>This icon is actually very small in the onCourse interface, so we blew it up a bit
				to get an idea of what you are looking for in onCourse. When you see this icon,
