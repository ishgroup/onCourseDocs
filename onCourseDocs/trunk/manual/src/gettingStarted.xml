		<section xml:id="gettingStarted-gettingAround">
			<title>Getting around</title>
			<para>This part of the onCourse manual will focus on the basics of the onCourse interface like
				windows, records and lists. To know how to use onCourse comfortably you need to know
				what all the windows, lists, records and cogwheels mean. onCourse is a customisable
				interface that can be tweaked to your liking. You can have multiple windows open in
				onCourse at any one time, allowing you to switch between processes on the fly, for
				example, you may be halfway through processing an enrolment when a colleague asks
				for some information on the class running in Room 3 today. You can open a new window
				to find the answer, without losing the information you are currently working on.
				Let's begin our journey of the onCourse interface.</para>
		</section>
		<section xml:id="gettingStarted-homeScreen">
			<title>The onCourse home screen</title>
			<para>The home screen is the opening window of onCourse, it is the first thing you will
				see on your screen after you successfully login. The home screen is split into five
				tabs: Course setup, Customer Service, Accounts, Marketing and Dashboard. You will
				find many buttons duplicated on each tab. The idea of these tabs is to group
				together the most common functions you would use if you worked primarily in one of
				these departments. You can switch between tabs as required.</para>
			<tip>
				<title>Popup messages on the right hand side</title>
				<para>It's important to read these popup messages on the right hand side of the
					window when you hover over each tab as they contain some valuable information
					that assists in your understanding of onCourse and it's components</para>
			</tip>
			<section>
				<title>Course Setup</title>
				<para>This tab contains everything related to getting courses set up, this is a good
					place to start once you've gone through everything in the first part of this
					manual. It's important to get all the settings and configurations ready before
					you do anything of importance in onCourse.</para>
				<para>The following options can be found in course setup. </para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Course : Courses are the product you provide. They describe what is
							taught and any accreditations which are achieved. If these
							accreditations change, then you should create a new course. Students do
							not enrol in a course directly, but can go on a waiting list for a
							course.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Class : Classes represent a group of students progressing through a
							class. A class has a cost, student enrolments, one or more tutors and
							start and end dates. You can easily duplicate classes ready for the next
							intake of enrolments.</para>
					</listitem>

					<listitem>
						<para>Unit of competency : Units of competency and Modules are single achievements, each
							resulting in an outcome for a student. Several units of competency make
							up a qualification as defined by national training packages. You can
							create courses which are single units, clusters of units or full
							qualifications.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Certificate : A certificate is documentary evidence of outcomes achieved by a student. A
							certficate could be a full qualification earned or a statement of
							attendance in several units of competency.</para>

				e.g; you opened the "class" list view, so you will see columns with headers like
				"sessions" "fee" and "tutor".</para>
			<para>On the left of this window will be the filters, these filters allow you to sort
				the data in the list according to characteristics that you have specified like
				"Current Classes", this will show all classes whose last day have not yet been
				surpassed.</para>
			<para>On the right of the class list window, you will find the actual records. Click on
				a header to sort by that column alphabetically. You can click the column heading
				again to sort by reverse alphabetical order. Some columns can't be sorted by,
				because they are calculation results e.g. the column Enrolments in the class list is
				a calculation of all the current active enrolments in the class.</para>
			<para>You can also drag and drop columns in the list view to re-order them into a
				display of your preference. Your preferences are saved as part of your unique user
				log in.</para>
			<para>Advanced and simple searches are also available from the list view, and all record
				printing happens from the list view. The cog wheel function in the top right hand
				corner also has list view specific functions available. </para>
			<para>In the list view, you can add and delete records. On the top right hand corner of
				most list views, you will see both an add and remove symbol, as you can see below.
				Click on the add symbol to add a new record, you will most likely need to fill out
				fields and check boxes to fill the criteria needed for that particular
				record.</para>
			<para>To remove a record, simply highlight the record you want to remove, click on the
				remove button and the record will disappear, of course if you do this, you can
				corrupt data in onCourse especially if they have immutable relationships. See (red
				caution box) for more on immutable relationships, so take the utmost care when
				removing anything in onCourse.</para>

			<para>An example of not being able to remove something with an immutable relationship or

			<para>When in the list view, you can select single or multiple records, why is this
				useful you ask? Well, if you want to print a report for multiple classes for
				example, you can just highlight which classes you want and go to File > Print > and
				select the type of report you want. You could also highlight a few records to delete
				them.</para>
			<para>Obviously, to choose one record you just click on it. </para>
			<para>When choosing multiple selections you can do the following:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Windows: Control plus left mouse click on each record you want to
						select.</para>

				<listitem>
					<para>Mac: Command plus left mouse click on each record you want to
						select.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>You also have the ability to sort list views by multiple columns at once, by holding down
				the shift key and clicking on multiple column headers. The sort order is determined
				by the order the column headers are clicked upon i.e the first column clicked is the
				primary sort order, followed by the second column clicked and so on.</para>

	<section xml:id="gettingStarted-filtersAndQuery">
		<title>Filters and query</title>
		<para>With so much data and information available to you in onCourse, it can sometimes get a
			little overwhelming. You need a way to organise and structure your data, this is where filters
			and queries come into play. </para>
		<para>The simplest way of organising your data is to sort by column. When you open a list view,
			you will see columns with different values. An example would be the "Course" field in
			"class". This column will list the name of the Course for this class. To sort a column
			you simply click onto it to sort by what type of values they are, so if the column
			contains names, then the column will be organised alphabetically, clicking on it again
			will sort it reverse alphabetically. See the screenshot below to get an idea of how this
			works.</para>
		<mediaobject>
			<imageobject>
				<imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/courseSorted.png"
					format="png" />
			</imageobject>
			<caption>
				<para>A column that has been sorted.</para>
			</caption>
		</mediaobject>
		<para>You could also expand the size of a column by hovering over the left or right side of the
			column until a black cross appears, then dragging left or right to expand or shrink.</para>
		<note><para>Only columns that are static have the ability to be sorted. So since columns such as Enrolments and Vacanies are dynamic we prevented them from being able to be sorted because this would have massively slowed down the speed of onCourse.</para></note>
		<section>
			<title>Core Filters</title>
			<para>Core filters are a way to sort your data on a larger scale, an example of these would be
				in the "class" list view, you will find core filters like:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Current classes</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Future classes</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Unscheduled classes</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Past classes</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Cancelled classes</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>By combining these with a another smaller filter, like "subject" you can have a list of
				Past classes that are tagged with Computing. On the title bar of the window you will see
				something like Classes (XX shown of XXX), where X represents numbers. In the screenshot
				below this has been done, look at the left to get a clear idea of how this works.</para>
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/coreFilters.png"
						format="png" />
				</imageobject>
				<caption>
					<para>A core filter working with tags.</para>
				</caption>
			</mediaobject>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Tag Groups</title>
			<para>Tag groups are basically a family of tags. The best way to think of them is to imagine a
				tree, you have a "root" tag like Subjects, then you have "branches" like "Computing" and
				then you'd have the leaf "Computing - Animation". You can set these tags by going to File >
				Preferences > Tags. To learn how to create tags see the <link xlink:href="tagging.html">Tagging chapter</link>. Tags you
				have created become filters in the relevant list view window.</para>
			<para>For example, a tag group which applies to courses will be available in the classes
				window, and as a filter mean 'show the classes belonging to courses tagged with...' This
				means you do not also have to tag classes with subject tags to filter on them. In the
				students window, the meaning of the subject tag group as filter will change again to mean
				'show the students enrolled in classes linked to courses tagged with...'</para>
		</section>
		<section xml:id="gettingStarted-queryTask">
			<title>Simple Queries</title>
			<para>As many advanced searching and sorting features as there are, sometimes you just want to
				search for something quick, this is where you would use the quick query search option. It's
				extremely simple, just like searching in a search engine, you type what you want in the
				search field in the top left hand side. But do make sure it is clear and doesn't say
				anything in it like "advanced find" as this indicates there is already a query running. </para>
			<para>Queries and filters work together, so if you have the core filters in the class window
				running, 'current classes' and 'future classes', this means that any query you run is only
				being run on the records already displayed in the list by your filters. If you want to query
				across all the records in the table, uncheck any running filters first.</para>
			<para>The simple query field works on record names and codes. If you type "b" then any record
				with a name or code starting with "b" will be brought up in the list, typing something else
				like "a" will put the first letter and second letter together and search for records
				beginning with "ba", see the screenshot below for a clearer idea of how this works.</para>

			</mediaobject>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Advanced Queries</title>
			<para>Advanced queries are used when you need to search on more than the filters or quick
				search options. For example, you may wish to find all the classes that started within a
				particular date range.</para>
			<para>To open the Advanced Search option, click on the magnifying glass icon in the search
				window in the top left hand corner of the screen. This will display the query editor.</para>
			<para>When you write a query, you have the option of choosing to find records matching <guimenuitem>All</guimenuitem> or
				records matching <guimenuitem>Any</guimenuitem> of the following. It is important that you choose the right
				option for the results you are expecting. The all query means that each line of your
				query will have an AND meaning e.g. Find class starting after 1/1/11 AND classes
				starting before 1/4/11. If you choose the <guimenuitem>Any</guimenuitem> option, your query lines will have
				an OR meaning. Find class starting after 1/1/11 OR classes starting before 1/4/11
				will return a different list of results to the first example.</para>
			<para>You can add as many lines as you require to your query. The list of fields available
				will be all the fields from the table. Some special cross table fields may also be
				available, like 'tagged with'.</para>
			<para>Depending on the field type, you will have different options to choose from. For example,
				text fields will include options like begins with, ends with, is, is not, contains,
				is empty and is not empty. Example cases of when you would need to use the 'is
				empty' and 'is not empty' options in the advanced search are as follows:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Finding students who have/don't have a USI</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Finding students who haven't supplied a date of birth</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Finding classes which have a purchasing contract identifier</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Finding enrolments which have a commitment ID</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>You can also add wildcard character to your text field searches by using %. For
				example, if I wanted to exclude all classes with a code starting with CS I could
				choose, code is not CS%. Note that many text based searches, like course and class
				code are case sensitive.</para>
			<para>You can also run an advanced search on Classes by State of Site, simply by selecting <guimenuitem>Site State</guimenuitem>within the advanced search options. </para>
			<para>Some fields are date fields and you can either type the date in by short date format
				e.g. 1/1/11 or choose the date from the calendar. Date fields can also be relative, for
				example, you can write the word today or +7 for the date seven days after today. This is
				particularly useful if you want to create a saved find for what is happening this week. Even
				though the dates will resolve to a particular date in the query editor, the find will
				continue to run as a relative search. If you run it today, it will show the results for
				today, if you run it again next week, it will show the results for the day you have run it. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Saved Finds</title>
			<para>Saved finds are a way to have your most commonly used queries available to you every
				time you need them, without having to resort to the advanced find feature every time. To
				create a saved find, follow these steps:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>In a list view, you will find a search field with a magnifying glass icon in the top

				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>You will notice the words "Advanced find" in the text field, this means an advanced

			<section xml:id="gettingStarted-duplicateClasses">
				<title>Duplicate classes</title>
				<para>You can also duplicate one or many classes with the cogwheel. This is a useful way to move
					all your programs forward in time. For example, if you want to offer the same
					series of classes again in 3 months time, you can duplicate them all in one go,
					and work out the start date 3 months from the start date of your first class you
					are duplicating from. E.g. the original series started on Monday 4th July and
					you want the next series to start on Monday 3rd September. You can enter either
					the date or number of days, and the other field will calculate. Ensure the days

			<listitem>
				<para>Next: If you press this, the very next record in the list will load its data into the
					record view, this will basically close the record you were just looking at and replace the
					data with the next record in line. Note that this could take a few seconds as it is
					bringing up a lot of data from the record. Its a faster way than closing the current
					record view and opening another record view. If you have made any changes to the record,
					you will promoted to save before moving forwards.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Previous: Like the "next" button, pressing on the previous button will load the
					previous record or the record before the record you are currently viewing. You may be
					prompted to save first.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Cancel: After clicking on this button, you will be asked if you want to discard
					changes or save changes. Discarding means you are not saving you changes on closing. This
					will only occur if you have made any changes, otherwise the window will just close.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Save: This button will save your changes to the record and close, it won't ask you for
					anything unlike the "cancel" button. When you close a record view, you will returned to
					your previous list view.</para>

			<title>Open related records</title>
			<para>The open related records icon will appear in carious windows throughout onCourse. This
				little icon is very useful, as it opens the record in a new window. The best way to define
				it is to give you an example of what it is used for:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>If you are confirming class details for a student on the phone, they may want to
						know more about the units of competency assigned to the course. This little icon will
						appear to the right for the name of the course, simply click, check the course VET
						details in the window that pops up, and choose cancel when you have completed viewing
						the record. The screenshots below illustrate this process.</para>

					<para>The "open related record" icon</para>
				</caption>
			</mediaobject>
			<para>This icon is actually very small in the onCourse interface, so we blew it up a bit to
				get an idea of what you are looking for in onCourse. When you see this icon, click on it to
				open the related record. For example, if this icon is near a students name "John Smith",
				then click on it and "John Smith" record will appear for you to edit.</para>

			<title>Clairvoyant fields and drag and drop</title>
			<para>Many text fields inside onCourse are clairvoyant, or look up fields. This means when you
				start typing in them, a list of matching drop down options appears for you to select. In
				Quick Enrol, this lets you easily work out if the student enrolling is a new or returning
				student, or allows you to quickly find all the courses starting with 'Cook..'</para>

			<para>To do this, have both windows open side by side. Click and hold down on the record you

				field, and the clairvoyance will load it.</para>
