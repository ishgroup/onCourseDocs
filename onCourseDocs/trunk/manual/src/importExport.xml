	<title>Importing and exporting</title>
	<para>onCourse offers you a large number of ways to get data into and out of the system. One of
		the key advantages of onCourse is that the data is completely under your control.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Copying and pasting</title>
			<para>It almost seems too easy - just select any records in any list view then choose
				copy from the edit menu and paste the data into Excel or a text editor.</para>
			<para>The data you copy and then paste will come out in the same column layout and sort
				order as the window you copied it from.</para>
			<para>If you have opened a very large list of data, please note that it may take some
				time for this list to load into your onCourse client memory. This is a process that
				runs in the background of onCourse, and not something immediately visible to you as
				a user. If you try to copy and paste from a list before the load process has
				completed, the copy process will not be successful. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>From the list view</title>
			<para>Each list view in onCourse has the ability to export data in an almost infinite
				variety of formats. You can either highlight the records you wish to export and
				choose "Import/Export > Export (tablename)" from under the File menu. </para>
			<para>Alternatively you can highlight the records you wish to export and click on the
				Export icon.</para>

					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>onCourse enables you to export your data in raw XML format, this
				includes courses, classes, sessions, tutors, sites and rooms all of which can be
				easily be imported into a publishing product such as Adobe InDesign and customised
				however you wish. The resulting file can then be sent to the printing company of
				your choice. There are advanced instructions for importing and working with XML
				here. ish is also able to work with you to assist you in the production of printed
				course catalogues if do not have existing design or printing capabilities, or access
				to desktop publishing software.</para>

			<title>Direct access to the SQL database</title>
			<para>Although we largely recommend that you produce reports within onCourse itself, it
				is also possible to connect to the backend database directly. If you are using a
				third party database like MySQL or MS-SQL you will already know how to do this. If
				you are using the built in database which comes with onCourse server, use the
				following connection properties. Start with a tool such as Squirrel SQL or DBeaver
				and use them to browse your data. Once you have that working, you can use any
				reporting tool (JasperBI, Automate, Crystal Reports, etc) to extract and report on
				data.<programlisting>
	       JDBC Driver:  org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver
	       JDBC URL: jdbc:derby://&lt;server hostname&gt;/onCourse
	       username: report
	       password: 948ty
            </programlisting></para>
			<para>It is important to note that you should NEVER write to the database. Not only do
				you risk introducing bad data, but you bypass all of the onCourse 'business logic'
				which holds together the financial and relational integrity of the data.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>AVETMISS export</title>
			<para>To export your AVETMISS go to the file menu, select import/export and choose
				Export AVETMISS. Select the date range you wish to export and where you wish to
				export the files to, e.g. your desktop, and select proceed. The 10 txt files will
				then be created ready to be submitted to the government reporting agency of your
				choice. Easy as! </para>

			<title>Sending messages</title>
			<para>Although you can send emails and SMS directly from onCourse, you can also export a
				list of contact email and postal details so that you can use an external mailing
				system, mail merge in Word or send a list of addresses to an external mailing house.
				More details about how to export from the messages window can be found in the <link

							drag any element into a text box in your layout and have the text
							automatically flow through.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Use the "map tags to style..." menu item to map the tags against your
							paragraph and character style sheets. Once this is done you can save the
							mapping so that next time you create this document with fresh data all
							the styles are linked quickly and simply.</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist></para>
			<para>If you now spend a bit of time tidying up your stylesheets (both character styles
				and paragraph styles) in inDesign you can set up the whole process to be almost
				completely automated. Next time you export from onCourse, the data will flow right
				into inDesign complete with all the formatting you need. Just paginate your
				brochure, place in some pictures and you are done.</para>
			<para>When you are ready to customise your export further, read the following section on
				how to edit the export formatter.</para>

			<title>Custom export templates</title>
			<para>You've seen how easy it can be to export course information from onCourse. You can
				also customise the output and create any type of publication you can dream of. You
				might export payroll data to an obscure finance system or send data to an external
				CRM system.</para>
			<para>onCourse exports are powered by a groovy based scripting language. These scripts
				run on the server and call the same groovy API that you'll find in the scripting
				chapter. That means that you can use the full power and expression of the groovy
				language, and access the entire onCourse schema. In short, you access the data to
				exports from the variable "records" and just return from the script the formatted
				text to export. This gives you infinite flexibility.</para>
			<para>We've built in a CSV toolkit, so exporting to CSV is really simple. And tab
				delimited output can be treated just like CSV but with tab separators between the
				fields.</para>
