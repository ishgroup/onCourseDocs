	<section xml:id="invoice-general">
		<title>Invoices</title>
		<para>Every time you create a purchase through Quick Enrol, an invoice (or several invoices) will
			be automatically created for you. You can see the details of that invoice within Quick
			Enrol and add additional custom lines (such as a surcharge for phone payments).</para>
		<para>Invoice lines automatically created by Quick Enrol may include purchases of
			enrolments, products, vouchers or memberships. Each item purchased will create an
			invoice line. Payment against an invoice may be taken at the time of creation or at a
			later date. Be default, all invoices created will have a due date of today, but you can
			manually enter a different due date at the time or creation, or by editing the invoice
			after creation. You can also add a customer reference to an invoice, where
			required.</para>
		<para>These invoices are then visible within the Invoice lists view. Like all other lists
			you can sort, search, export and print from this view. Invoices may not be deleted and
			all of the financial information within an invoice may not be edited once created.
			Although this may seem like an inconvenience, immutable invoices are extremely important
			to ensure a robust audit trail and to guarantee the integrity of the general ledger
			transactions.</para>
		<para>If you need to modify an invoice you should instead create a credit note. A credit note is
			an invoice where the invoice lines have negative dollar values. Remember if you are
			cancelling an enrolment or a class there are easier ways to do that from the class and
			enrolment list views.</para>
		<para>A credit note is an invoice with a negative total and is shown alongside invoices in the
			same list view. The owing amounts on an invoice and a credit note are not automatically
			zeroed against each other, however you can cancel them out by using the cog wheel option
			'contra invoice'.</para>
		<para>You can view the list of invoices by either clicking on the 'Invoice' button found in the
			'Customer Service' and 'Account' tabs of the dashboard, or by using the top menu and by
			going Financial -> Invoices. </para>
		<note>
			<para>The 'Overdue' column will show the total unpaid component of the invoice that is due prior
				to tomorrow e.g. amounts due today, and in the past, which are unpaid are considered
				overdue. This updates daily, not in real time.</para>

			<title>Creating an invoice</title>
			<para>While you will usually create an invoice through using Quick Enrol, it is sometimes useful
				to create an invoice without an associated product or enrolment. You can easily do
				that by opening the list of invoices and pressing the plus icon at the top
				right.</para>
			<para>Remember to associate each invoice line with the correct income account code. Once
				you save the invoice you will not be able to change this code. </para>

		<section xml:id="invoice-linking">
			<title>Link invoice lines to classes</title>
			<para>When creating invoice lines you may optionally link each line to a class. This will treat
				the income with the same general ledger pre-paid fees and income deferral plan as
				invoices created by enrolling in the class. This also adds the total of that invoice
				line to the class budget and can be very useful when invoicing a company for an
				entire classroom delivery without recording individual enrolments or need to include
				additional income such as funding in a classes budget. </para>

			<title>Duplicating Invoices</title>
			<para>You have the ability to duplicate invoice by highlighting the invoice you want to duplicate
				in the Invoice list view,  then click on the cogwheel and select the option
				'Duplicate invoice'. This allows you to quickly re-create invoices from a previous
				invoice template, but change contact, change the value or add a negative symbol for
				a credit note.</para>
			<note><para>This feature can only be used when a single invoice is selected at a time.</para></note>

	<section xml:id="invoice-paymentPlan">
		<title>Payment plans</title>
		<para>By default invoices have a due of the day they are created. Sometimes you will want to allow
			students to pay for training over a longer period of time. Using payment plans you can
			set the amount of the up front deposit and a series of dates for payment of the
			remainder in instalments. </para>
		<section xml:id="invoice-dueDate">
			<title>Invoice due dates</title>
			<para>An existing or new invoice can be converted to a payment plan by adding payment due dates. </para>
			<para>It is important that the total of the payment plan amounts equals the invoice
				total; you will not be able to save the invoice unless they match. The 'Overdue'
				column in the Invoices list view will show the total unpaid component of the invoice
				that is due prior to tomorrow.</para>
			<para>You can also edit payment plan amounts and due dates at any time, for example if
				you grant the student an extension to the payment plan.</para>
		</section>
		<section xml:id="invoice-payPlanTemplate">
			<title>Class payment plan template</title>
			<para>If you wish to offer a deferred payment scheme to all students in a particular class you
				can set up a payment plan templates from the class edit view you where you normally
				set the class fee. </para>
			<para>This can be quite useful if you an RTO who is bound by the Standards that limit
				your prepayment of fees to $1,500. For example, if you offer a 10-week course that
				costs $2000, the course costs $200 per week. Therefore, you could collect $1500 at
				the time of enrolment and the remaining $500 after week seven without needing to
				have any protection measures in place.</para>
			<para>You may also like to use payment plans as part of your online marketing strategy,
				by encouraging students to commit to enrolment early with a small refundable payment
				(say, $100), with the remainder of the fee becoming due on the class
				commencement.</para>
			<para>The payment plan template can include an amount on enrolment (deposit) and as many
				other amounts on dates relative to the start of the class. If you subsequently
				adjust the class timetable and change the class start date then the payment plan
				template will automatically be adjusted. When you duplicate classes the payment plan
				template will also be adjusted with the new timetable.</para>
			<para>To create a payment plan for a class where the fee has already been set, you may
				wish to click the lock icon next to the class fee first. This will ensure the
				payment plan adds up to the existing class fee, rather than add additional costs to
				the class fee. The 'on enrolment' fee will auto adjust to the amount
				remaining.</para>
			<para>Each payment line you add requires an offset date from the class start. This offset can be
				positive (days after) or negative (days before). The actual due dates for the
				payments for this class will be calculated and shown in the payment plan
				screen.</para>

			<title>Quick Enrol</title>
			<para>During enrolment info a class with a payment plan, only the deposit amount will
				normally be charged at enrolment. The payment field will auto adjust to this amount,
				but you can manually alter it to be more or less as you need.</para>
			<para>If, at the time of enrolment, the next payment dates have already passed those
				amounts will also be charged. So, let's take an example class with a $1000 deposit
				and $500 due 7 days before the start of class. A student enrolling 10 days before
				the class starts will be charged $1000 and a student enrolling 5 days before class
				starts will be charged $1500. </para>
			<para>During Quick Enrol every involvement with a different payment plan will be added to a
				separate invoice. In this way a single Quick Enrol process may generate two or more
				invoices. If several enrolments have an identical payment plan, then they will end
				up on the same invoice.</para>

			<title>Online enrolments</title>
			<para>If a payment plan applies to the class, we suggest you make some note of it in the class
				web tab, so a potential student enrolling via the web can see what amount is payable
				and when. The full class fee will still display in the class block when a payment
				plan applies.</para>

			<para>When the student completes the enrolment process, the 'pay now' component will be
				reduced to the deposit payable. The invoice the student receives on completion of
				the enrolment process will itemise the remaining payment components and their due
				dates.</para>

		<section xml:id="invoice-script">
			<title>Automating payment plans with scripts</title>
			<para>If you have payment plan templates to create for very many classes you may wish to instead
				use a script to automate the process. A simple script might identify all classes
				with a fee over $1500 and then limit the amount due on enrolment to $1500 with the
				remainder payable over the duration of the class.</para>
			<para>More sophisticated payment plan scripts can create different plans depending on
				the duration of the class, the amount of the fee, whether the class is VET or not
				and any other criteria.</para>
