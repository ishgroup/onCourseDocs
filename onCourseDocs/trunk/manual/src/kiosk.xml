        <title>Kiosk Mode for Sites</title>
        <para>The onCourse kiosk mode is designed to show on a monitor or tablet the classes that
            are running at a particular site or room today. A large screen in a foyer or tablet
            outside each room is an inexpensive way to always show up to date information to tutors
            and students.</para>
        <para>Clicking on the TV icon in the top right hand corner of the site edit view will
            generate a URL that looks like <code>https://www.mycollege.com.au/site/kiosk/111</code>
            where www.mycollege.com is the URL in your general preferences College Website URL and
            111 is the unique site ID.</para>
        <para>Once you have clicked on the link to open the URL and can confirm it is displaying as
            expected, enter this onto your display device. Once you have set the URL it will update
            itself regularly to show current information at all times.</para>

        <para>The data shown in kiosk mode will be the real time data of today's classes that are
            either in progress, or yet to commence. The data is sorted by start time order, and then
            alphabetically. As classes complete, they automatically drop off the list.</para>

        <title>Kiosk Mode for Rooms</title>
        <para>A kiosk view is also available for each room of a site, to display the classes running
            today. This is the URL you would access if you wish to display the details for all
            classes scheduled in a particular room, for example, to display on a tablet located near
            the room's door.</para>
        <para>Click on the TV icon in the top right hand corner of the Room edit view to access the
            URL for that room. The URL will be your college site appended with something like
                <code>/room/kiosk/469</code> where "469" is the onCourse unique ID for the
            room.</para>

        </mediaobject>
        <para>Like the kiosk view for a site, the room view will only show classes in progress and
            scheduled for today. As the class session completes, it will drop off the list
            automatically. </para>

        <title>Customising the kiosk</title>
        <para>You can customise the design of the kiosk in three ways, from simplest first:</para>
        <section>
            <title>Adding a logo</title>
            <para>Log into your website webDAV interface (see the design handbook for details) and
                put your logo at the path <code>/kiosk/img/logo.png</code>. This will place your
                logo in the top left corner of the kiosk.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Adding your own styles</title>
            <para>Put a css file at <code>/kiosk/css/kiosk-local.css</code>and override any of the
                default styles with your own.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title/>
            <para>The kiosk is just another tml file like all other parts of your site, so you can
                make more radical changes by changing the kiosk pages and components through
                webDAV.</para>
