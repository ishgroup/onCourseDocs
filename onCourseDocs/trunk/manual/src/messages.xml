	<para>You can view the Messages section here - <link
			xlink:href="https://demo.cloud.oncourse.cc/messages"/></para>
	<para>onCourse can send a mix of email or SMS messages to the contacts you have collected contact
		details for. Contacts can also manage their subscriptions to your public tag groups via
		their onCourse web portal.</para>
	<para>Whenever you create a message using the onCourse interface, the collected list of contacts is
		automatically de-duplicated so you don't send someone the same message twice, and the list
		can be sent a combination of email &amp; SMS depending on the contact details you have
		available. Selected contacts without the chosen method or methods or communication available
		can be exported into a separate list so you can manually contact them.</para>
	<para>Contacts who have asked not to be contacted via particular methods e.g. SMS are
		automatically suppressed from messaging lists. You can override this suppression in the case
		of emergency contact e.g. a message to advise students that their tutor is sick and a
		session is cancelled.</para>
	<para>onCourse messaging is for outbound messages only. Inbound messages will be sent to the
		reply address specified in your message and will not be visible in onCourse.</para>

		<section>
			<title>From contact, tutor or student lists</title>
			<para>If you wish to find a group of contacts who have a particular history of interactions with
				your college, onCourse will allow you to perform advanced search functions, then use
				the combined email &amp; SMS messaging tool to contact these clients. For example,
				you can search for all students who enrolled in a course containing the word
				"french" in the last 365 days and then send them all an invitation to enrol in your
				new class, Provence Study Tour, prior to its public release. Any of the standard and
				advanced search mechanisms in the contact list view can be used to choose people to
				send a message to.</para>
			<para>Once you have made your selection, highlight the people you wish to contact and choose
				"send message..." from the cogwheel in the bottom right. You can send a message in
				this way to 1 person or 20,000 people, and onCourse has special code to optimise
				delivery to very large lists.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>From classes</title>
			<para>Highlight one or more classes from the class list view and choose "send message to tutors
				from..." or "send message to student from..." from the cogwheel. Every tutor or
				student from those classes will be sent a message.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>From waiting lists</title>
			<para>Highlight one or more records in the waiting list view and choose "send message..." from
				the cogwheel. Every potential student will be sent a message of your creation. A
				good way to use this is to search for all waiting list records for a particular
				course or group of courses. Then send them a message to let them know a new class
				has just been scheduled and let them know to enrol online or call the office. Read
					<link xlink:href="waitingLists.html">here</link> for more information about
				waiting lists.</para>

	<section xml:id="messages-intergratedMail">
		<title>Sending an integrated mail message</title>
		<para>The type of message you want to send depends on the Template you select in the Send
			Message window. If you select an email template, you will send an email. If you select
			an SMS template, you will send an SMS. The window heading will update with either Email
			or SMS to confirm your selection.</para>
		<para>As emails and SMS's use Message Templates to define their styling, you do not need to
			type out any code when sending a message. Simply select your template, type out your
			message and hit send. The message will capture any line breaks without the need for
			adding HTML tags.</para>
		<para>ish onCourse integrates email &amp; SMS export functionality within the database. This means
			that not only can you quickly contact all students who studied with you last term, or
			quickly reschedule a class when the tutor calls in sick, but that a full history of all
			these messages are stored right in the students' records.</para>
		<para>Sophisticated bounce processing is in place for email, notifying you if a message is
			undeliverable.</para>
		<para>After you have selected the list of people you wish to contact using one of the
			methods described in the previous section, you can begin selecting the methods which you
			will use to contact them.</para>
		<para>For example, if you have 26 contacts selected in a message window and of those 26, 22
			have email addresses available to contact, there will be 4 people who are listed as
			'wont be contacted'.  If you have mobile phone numbers for those four people you could
			chose to SMS them only, by selecting the option 'send SMS' and not including people who
			are emailed. By using this combined method you can reach more people via their preferred
			medium, or in the case of emergencies, attempt to reach people via multiple
			mediums.</para>

			<title>Understanding email messaging</title>
			<para>Email messaging in onCourse is managed by your own mail server. In the Messaging section of
				the Preferences window, you can set up the email server address and account details.
				You can also set up how bounced emails are processed. More information is available
				in the <link xlink:href="generalPrefs.html">General Preferences
				chapter</link></para>
			<para>Not every email you send from onCourse will reach the intended contact. There are many
				reasons for this and they include:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>The email address you collected from the student was incorrect. This is less likely if
						the student enrolled online and was required to type in their email address
						themselves rather than have a staff member translate it from a handwritten
						form. Common errors include incorrect domain names e.g. bigpond.com.au
						instead of bigpond.com and simple typos. If the user account you are trying
						to send to doesn't exist, you should expect an undeliverable message to the
						'from' address used when you sent the message and the message will be marked
						as failed in onCourse.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The user's account marked your message as spam. onCourse emails are sent one at a time to
						your email server, so if the user has successfully received email from you
						in the past, there is no difference between a message sent out of onCourse
						than one sent directly from your own email account. There is no notification
						to you if the message is marked as spam, and will show as 'sent' in
						onCourse. Their spam filter may have quarantined your message for reasons
						like using keywords in your message body such as 'special offer', 'Dear
						sir/madam' or other negatively scoring terms. Read up on keywords that are
						commonly blocked at <link
							xlink:href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/tests_3_3_x.html">Spam
							Assassin</link></para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The user's account is full, or otherwise unavailable for accepting
						messages. The user account may have been disabled by their system
						administrator, i.e. if an employee has left an organisation, or is possibly
						unavailable due to technical issues like their mail server losing it's
						internet connection. Your own mail server may attempt to resend the message,
						depending or the response it has received. You may see the message in
						onCourse remains in a queued state. On the sixth failed attempt the message
						will be discarded and you will see in onCourse the message marked as failed
						and the users email address marked as undeliverable.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Problems with your own mail server sending large numbers of outbound
						messages. If you are sending a large number of emails for an email campaign,
						your own mail server may have some established rules to block potential spam
						activity from inside your network. Before you begin sending 500 or more
						messages, speak to your mail server manager and ensure there are no system
						policies that will prevent you from running your marketing campaign.</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<section>
				<title>Plain text and HTML messages</title>
				<para>Messages sent manually through onCourse use Message Templates which contain two types of
					email formats - plain and HTML, each contained within a single message template.
					HTML messages are formatted and usually include images, hyperlinks and styled
					font and content. A plain text email message is just that - it contains only
					plain text without any additional styling.</para>
				<para>Message Templates can be edited in the Automation window, under the Message Templates
					heading. You can create both Email and SMS templates.</para>
				<para>
					<note>

			<title>Understanding SMS Messaging</title>
			<para>SMS messaging is available in onCourse and can be a method of communication for
				any contacts with a valid mobile number. Note that only the phone number recorded in
				the mobile phone field is used - if you have recorded a mobile phone number in the
				work or home number fields, it will not be available for SMS.</para>
			<para>There is no requirement for formatting the mobile phone number in onCourse to make
				it accessible. 10 digits are standard for a mobile phone, beginning in Australia
				with 04. Whether or not you format your phone numbers with spaces it up to you -
				onCourse will strip out these characters during the outbound SMS, without modifying
				any of the data you have stored.</para>
			<para>A small charge per use applies to SMS messaging, as per your onCourse contract agreement.
				The outbound message from information is defined in the Messaging section of the
				Preferences window, in the 'SMS from' field. Most companies use their business name
				here, so they do not need to identify themselves in the message body. Like email,
				SMS messaging is outbound only, and if you use a name in the from field, there is no
				ability for the customer to respond. Alternatively you could use a valid mobile
				number in your settings, if you wished to accept inbound SMS also, and remember to
				identify your business name in each SMS you send.</para>
			<para>It is important to remember that SMS messages are not delivered in real time, even
				though most peoples experiences of mobile phones work that way. Like email, SMS
				messages are handled through a delivery network but in this case delivery rules are
				all managed by the receiver's mobile phone provider. Most providers give about a two
				day time-to-live on SMS messages. This means if the phone is off the network (no
				coverage or switched off) and re-registers on the network within two days that the
				message was sent, then it will be received. If the phone is off the network for
				longer than that, then the mobile phone provider may discard the message entirely.
				There is no notification back to the sender if the message is successfully delivered
				or discarded.</para>
			<para>Inside the contact record in onCourse, the message is marked as sent if it makes
				it successfully to the outbound SMS gateway. Beyond that point the message can not
				be tracked. Please contact ish if you find SMS messages are failing as there may be
				instances where the SMS gateway is experiencing a fault.</para>

	<section xml:id="messages-optInAndOut">
		<title>Messaging opt in and opt out</title>
		<para>Students have the option to opt out of all marketing communication from your organisation,
			or from a particular method of marketing such as SMS. However, if you have urgent information
			to convey, such as a class cancellation, you are still able to use your communication tools to
			contact them quickly while respecting their request not to receive unsolicited marketing
			emails or SMS. </para>
		<para>During the online enrolment process, students can opt of our messaging from any type
			when they are providing their contact details. By default, all types of communication
			are set to allow. Student's can also log into their portal at any time and change their
			preferences.</para>

		<title>Automatic messages in onCourse</title>
		<para>When a student enrols in a class and an invoice is created, two automatic emails are sent

		<para>onCourse uses standard templates to send plain text emails to payers and students.
			These emails can be resent from the enrolment window cogwheel or the invoice window
			cogwheel. These reports can also be printed in hard copy and mailed to the student if
			required. Note that the format for the printed and emailed invoices and enrolment
			confirmation are different, due to the different mediums they are sent with, but they
			contain the same information.</para>
