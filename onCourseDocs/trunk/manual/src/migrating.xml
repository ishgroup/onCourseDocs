    <title>Migrating to onCourse</title>
    <para>Unless you are a brand new training organisation, you probably already have student and enrolment data. You may want to migrate some, or all, of this data to onCourse as part of the setup and implementation process.</para>
    <para>There are many reasons both for and against migrating data from a legacy system. The first
        consideration is will you have access to the legacy system once you have onCourse up and
        running? If the answer is yes, you should be quite choosy about what information you bring
        into onCourse, and only bring across data that serves a valid business purpose, such as
        contact data from the last three years. </para>
    <para>If you are using a commercial system under licence, which you will no longer have access
        to once you stop paying your licensing fees, and your are an RTO, you may be required by
        compliance standard to bring over as much information as possible so you can access 'old'
        training data, for as long as thirty years.</para>
    <para>Of course, garbage in equals garbage out. One of the reasons you may be moving to a new
        system is to start over and escape from poorly set up and invalid data in your current
        enrolment system. If that is a concern, then we would caution against importing this data
        into onCourse.</para>
    <para>Some data, like contact details, are quite simple to import from an external system. Other data, such as courses, classes and enrolments can be more complex.</para>
    <para>Every database has a schema that outlines how it's information is stored in tables and
        fields, and how the data in each table is related to data in other tables. Even though all
        student management systems roughly store the same sort of information about students,
        enrolments and outcomes that's about where the similarity ends. How they each do it is
        completely different. onCourse is as open and transparent to the world about our database
        schema as possible, and we publish this information on our public website. This makes it
        easy to migrate to, and away from, onCourse, without having to pay us for the privilege.
        However, many database system schemas are commercially confident, so exporting and importing
        usable structured data from them may be near on impossible.</para>
    <para>Every student management database is analogous to a human language, so converting your
        data from your current system to onCourse may be a bit like translating some text from
        English to Mandarin and then back to English. It's unlikely to come out looking quite the
        same way as it did when it went in. However, if your current system is capable of exporting
        contact data in CSV files or enrolment data in AVETMISS files, then we have included some
        basic import options in onCourse.</para>
    <para>Over the years, we have also developed other migration options for various custom and
        commercial products, so please don't hesitate to contact us if you want to bring across more
        data than AVETMISS includes, like tutor contact details or documents into the onCourse
        document management system. We may already have a tool we can use, or can provide you with a
        quote for a custom migration. </para>

        <title>DIY Migration options</title>
        <para>Looking for a low cost do-it-youself version? One of the strengths of onCourse is its
            comprehensive access to the data behind every field in the system. Every field in every
            object is accessible through the API, driven by groovy scripts. Out of the box, onCourse
            comes with several useful import scripts. </para>
       <section>
           <title>Contact CSV import</title>
           <para>Sometimes you just need a simple way to get contact data from Excel into onCourse.
                In onCourse, contacts can be students, tutors or companies. Format your Excel
                spreadsheet with the following columns (shown here in rows, with a sample data in
                the format "columnName : example data")</para>
            <para>The order of the columns isn't important, and you can leave columns blank where
                there is no data for that contact</para>
            <para>Every contact should have their own row. In this example, the contact is both a
                student and a tutor. For a contact that is only a tutor, all the student specific
                fields can be left blank.</para>

           <para>Then save your document as CSV and import it from the File -> Import menu. Remember
                that you will get duplicate contacts if you import the same records again, but you
                can use the onCourse <link
                    xlink:href="contacts.html">merge contacts feature</link> to resolve this manually.</para>

        <section>
            <title>AVETMISS 80/85</title>
            <para>All other student management systems designed for RTOs in Australia are able to export data to the AVETMISS standard. So if you can get your data out in this way, it is simple to bring it into onCourse. The 80 and 85 files contain just student information without any enrolments.</para>
            <para>There are two versions of this import. The first will bring in students and try to
                match the records already found in onCourse using the first name, last name and date
                of birth. If it cannot find a perfect match, then a new contact record will be
                created. For example, if the imported record doesn't have a date of birth, then a
                new record will be created in onCourse.</para>
            <para>The second version will also import the student number from the external system. If the student number is already used in onCourse then that student will be overwritten with the new data. Be careful with this import since it might be quite destructive if used on a system with a lot of existing data. However this option is quite useful if you want to preserve the student number between your old system and onCourse; you might want this if you are reporting for government funding and your exports from onCourse need to match the student numbers from your previous report.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>AVETMISS 60, 80, 85 and 120 </title>
            <para>This import works just the same way as the 80/85 import above, but it also brings
                in outcomes data. Although the AVETMISS standard calls the 120 file "enrolments" it
                actually represents what onCourse calls "outcomes". That is, just a relationship
                between the student and the modules/units of competency. In onCourse we cannot store
                that in the Enrolment because we'd need classes, courses and much more. The AVETMISS
                data isn't enough to reconstruct all that. Instead we create records in Prior
                Learning representing learning that was recorded outside of onCourse. All the
                important Outcome data is also imported and stored.</para>
            <para>You can run an AVETMISS export from your legacy system, submit it to the relevant
                training authorities, import that data to onCourse and then run another export with
                almost the same results. Minor changes may occur where onCourse applies validation
                rules during the export process to reduce your errors.</para>
            <para>When you export the AVETMISS data from your legacy system, make sure you export
                the entire date range you wish to bring across into a single set of files. If your
                legacy system only allows for the export of a maximum 12 months of data at a time,
                please contact us first. If you import multiple years in multiple sets of files, it
                is possible you will create quite a number of duplicate records in onCourse.</para>
            <para>If you are importing AVETMISS data into to onCourse, it is import that it is
                validated and as error free as possible. We suggest using the <link
                    xlink:href="https://avs.ncver.edu.au/avs/">NCVER AVS tool</link> to check your
                data prior to import.</para>
            <para>To import the NAT00060, NAT00080, NAT00085 and NAT00120 files, go to File > Import/Export > Import... and select the option
                'onCourse AVETMISS outcome import'. The import process will prompt you to open
                each of the NAT files listed above from a location on your computer.</para>
            <para>Once you have selected all four files, click on the import button on the
                bottom of the window.</para>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Custom Migration</title>
        <para>Because the import is just groovy, you have the full use of both the groovy and Java programming languages to parse one of more files in any way you need. You can format, interpret and chop up the data in any way you like. Then take the results, create objects in onCourse (students, enrolments, vouchers, etc) and commit them to the database. onCourse comes with json, XML, CSV and fixed width parsers so those file formats are easy.</para>           
         <para>You can also call an importer directly from onCourse scripts. So perhaps you might write an import format to bring in room Unavailability from an external room management system. Perhaps your rooms are shared across the campus and you need to get that data each day into onCourse. Simply write your script to fetch the data (perhaps a RESTful request) and pass it to the importer.</para>
        <para>We can also offer script writing and custom migration as a quoted service if you don't
            have the skills in house.</para>
