		<para> The Private Booking feature can be used when you are creating a once-off custom class
			booking for an individual or group enrolment. This feature allows you to create the
			class, set the fee and take the enrolment. </para>
		<para> You might use this feature to create one-on-one booking for extra tuition, a private dancing lesson for a couple, or a custom
			corporate class booking for a small group of staff. </para>
		<para> To begin, open the quick enrol window.</para>

			<listitem>
				<para>Type in a course name in the 'Enter course or item' field. This needs to be an existing
					course â€“ even if the class content is not the same you can select one that is
					similar Salsa eg. Latin and American for a private salsa booking. If you
					regularly take private bookings you may prefer to set up a course specifically
					for that purpose. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Once you have added the course you want to create a private booking for, you should see a
					button called 'Create Private Class' in the top right hand side of the window.
					Click on this button; this will open up a separate new window for you to create
					the custom class.</para>

				<para>Set a class code, a site and room and create a fee. Like all classes, the fee is per
					person, so if you are enrolling a couple, you can either set the fee to half the
					booking cost and charge them both, or set the fee to the full cost, and manually
					discount the second person to $0. </para>

			student(s) as per the normal enrolment process. </para>
