		<para> The Private Booking feature can be used when you are creating a once-off custom class booking for an individual or group
			enrolment. This feature allows you to create the class, set the fee and take the enrolment all in one window. </para>
		<para> You might use this feature to create one-on-one booking for extra tuition, a private dancing lesson for a couple, or a custom
			corporate class booking for a small group of staff. </para>
		<para> To begin, open the quick enrol window. From the add symbol in the top left corner, select "private booking". </para>

				<para> Type in a course name. This needs to be an existing course â€“ even if the class content is not the same you can select one
					that is similar Salsa eg. Latin and American for a private salsa booking. If you regularly take private bookings you may prefer to
					set up a course specifically for that purpose. </para>

				<para> Set a class code, a site and room and create a fee. Like all classes, the fee is per person, so if you are enrolling a

					discount the second person to $0. </para>
