		<title>Creating an enrolment with Checkout</title>
		<para>This section will provide you with clear and concise instructions on how to achieve certain
			things within Checkout, like enrolling a student.</para>
		<para>Every Checkout process generates an invoice, even if there is no payment involved.
			Sometimes, this invoice will be for $0.00, for example if there is no cost to enrol in
			the selected class. Sometimes the invoice will be paid in full on enrolment, and also be
			a receipt of payment. Sometimes the invoice will be partially paid or not paid at all.
			The default setting for Checkout to default payments to full payment or no payment is
			set in the Financial Preferences window.</para>
		<para>When processing an enrolment via the onCourse client, it is possible to issue an
			invoice to the customer who won't be paying the course fee at the time of enrolment,
			even if your usual preference is set to pay in full. This is done by changing the
			payment method to 'no payment' from the default option 'credit card'.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<title>A few things to consider first</title>
			<listitem>
				<para>A contact can be a student or a payer, a company can be listed as a payer but
					can not be a student. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Student names can be entered in this fashion: "Smith, John". When you type a
					comma, the auto complete looks up all students with "Smith" as a surname. As you
					continue to type letters of the first name, the list is reduced. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>You can also type student names like this: "John Smith". When you do this, the
					auto complete feature will not start showing you choices until you have typed a
					few letters of the student's surname. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If the student you are enrolling has a contact record at your college, you can
					select them from the list on the right hand side of the window. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>When searching for a students record a list will appear on the right of the
					window, you will see their full name, suburb, date of birth and email address,
					to assist you in selecting the right record.</para>
				<note>
					<para>The USI field will be disabled along with you not being able to change student name of
						date of birth, in Checkout, if the USI has been verified.</para>
				</note>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If the student you wish to enrol is new to your college, you can select the option "New
					contact..." which will appear on the right hand window when you click on the
					'Enter contact...' field.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Once you have selected your student, you will see their information in the Checkout
					window, this is the same information you see in their contact record, you can
					then make changes to any of the contact details, notes or AVETMISS information
					as needed. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If there is a third party payer you will need to add them as a contact and
					create a relationship to the student. This can be found at the bottom of the
					page under the General tab in the contacts record, it will say 'Above contact is
					X of the payer'.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>When you complete the enrolment, the changes will be saved. If you cancel the
					enrolment, your changes will not be saved.</para>

			<title>How to create an enrolment - Checkout Basics</title>
			<para>
				<note>
					<para>The most important thing to remember about Checkout is that all enrolments
						processed in a single onCourse Checkout process generate one invoice to a
						single payer. This could be for one student enrolling and paying for
						themselves in one or more classes, or another contact enrolling and paying
						for one or more students to enrol in one or more classes. <emphasis
							role="bold">If two friends are enrolling in a class together and paying
							separately, you would process their enrolments as two separate Checkout
							processes.</emphasis></para>

			<title>Discounting the enrolment fee</title>
			<para>When processing an enrolment through Checkout, you can discount course fees by using a
				pre-created discount. When a discount is applied to a class, it can be automatically
				offered to people who meet pre-defined criteria, e.g. seniors, people who hold a
				certain membership, students re-enrolling within a defined time period or students
				enrolling in a defined date range. You can also apply one manually by checking the
				Discount drop down box within the class invoice line of the Summary.</para>

					<para>The student must have been previously enrolled in a class.</para>

					<para>The student must have accrued either credit or debit depending on their

						or "Previous owing" in the Payments step of Checkout. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If the student has credit to their name, then the balance outstanding will

				being made or I recorded the wrong amount?</title>
			<para>If for example a student has not actually made a physical payment on their
				enrolment, but an onCourse user recorded their enrolment in onCourse as paid, you
				will need to follow these steps to resolve it. Only unreconciled payments can be
				reversed.</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Locate the payment record in the 'Payment in' window and select it by
						single clicking it</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>In the to right hand corner or the window, go to the cogwheel and select
						the option 'Reverse payment'. This will reverse the payment against the
						invoice(s) where it was originally applied. Those invoices will now have a
						balance outstanding.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>When you complete the reversal process, the status of the payment in will
						change from success to reversed.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>You can now process the correct payment in method at the time the student
						pays or for the correct amount that was received. </para>

			<title>How do I change part of an enrolment fee to a business, and part to a student? </title>
			<para>The best way to charge part of an enrolment fee to someone and another part to
				someone else would be to follow these steps. We will use an example of a $100
				enrolment where a student has paid half of an enrolment and the other half has been
				paid for by their job network agency:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a credit note for the student for $50 (half of the class fee). This
						will now drop their balance outstanding down to $50 (or $0 if they have
						already paid their half)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a manual invoice for the job network agency in the invoice window
						for the remaining $50.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Process the payment in for Job network invoice when they pay it. </para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>For an invoice, you can not record some of the payment coming from a person other
				than the payer (in this case the student). The reason you would use this method is
				so that if the student's enrolment is cancelled for some reason, they will only be
				entitled to a $50 refund, rather than the full $100. </para>

			<title>How do I provide a student with a discount after they have already enrolled?</title>
			<para>Invoices in onCourse are immutable; you can't change them after they have already been
				issued.</para>
			<para>You can choose to either cancel the original enrolment and process it again
				correctly, with the discount or you can create a manual credit note for the
				student</para>
			<para>If the student has already paid the full amount, they will end up with credit that
				can be refunded or used towards another enrolment. If the student hasn't paid
				against the original invoice, they will now have a lower balance due, because of
				their credit note.</para>

		<title>How do I check to see if a student has been enrolled?</title>
		<para>You can go to the Enrolment list view window and type the student's name into the basic
				search. Double-click on the record to open it and view it in more detail. You can
				also check within the Class record itself by scrolling down to the Enrolments
				section, then clicking the 'Successful and Queued' button to open the ENrolments
				window with all that classes current successful enrolments displayed.</para>
		<para>If you require more information about an individual enrolment you can double click on an
				record; this will open the enrolment record to show it in more detail.</para>

			<title>What happens if a student doesn't meet the class age restrictions?</title>
			<para>If a class has a minimum, maximum or age range set for enrolment in the General section of
				the class, then during Checkout, each student attempting to enrol in the class will
				have their date of birth checked.</para>
			<para>If the student doesn't have a date of birth at all, then they will not be allowed
				to enrol until a valid date of birth is provided.</para>
			<para>If the student has a date of birth that means they do not meet the age
				requirements, they will not be able to enrol.</para>
			<para>If the student is enrolling via the office, then their date of birth can be
				modified. If the student is self enrolling on the website, and has previously
				provided their date of birth, they can not change their date of birth without
				contacting the office. If you approve and change their date birth in onCourse, they
				will then be allowed to enrol in this class on the website.</para>
