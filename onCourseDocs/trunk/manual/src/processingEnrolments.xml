		<title>Creating an enrolment with Quick Enrol</title>
		<para>This section will provide you with clear and concise instructions on how to achieve
			certain things within onCourse Quick Enrol, like enrolling a student.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<title>A few things to consider first</title>
			<listitem>
				<para>A contact can be a student or a payer, a company can be listed as a payer but
					can not be a student. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Student names can be entered in this fashion: "Smith, John". When you type a
					comma, the auto complete looks up all students with "Smith" as a surname. As you
					continue to type letters of the first name, the list is reduced. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>You can also type student names like this: "John Smith". When you do this, the
					auto complete feature will not start showing you choices until you have typed a
					few letters of the student's surname. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If the student you are enrolling has a contact record at your college, you can
					select them from the list on the right hand side of the window. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>When searching for a students record a list will appear on the right of the
					window, you will see their full name, suburb, date of birth and email address,
					to assist you in selecting the right record.</para>
				<note>
					<para>The USI field will be disabled along with you not being able to change
						student name of date of birth, in Quick Enrol, if the USI has been
						verified.</para>
				</note>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If the student you wish to enrol is new to your college, you can select the
					option "New contactâ€¦" which will appear on the right hand window when you click
					on the 'Enter contact...' field.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Once you have selected your student, you will see their information in the
					Quick Enrol window, this is the same information you see in their contact
					record, you can then make changes to any of the contact details, notes or
					AVETMISS information as needed. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If there is a third party payer you will need to add them as a contact and
					create a relationship to the student. This can be found at the bottom of the
					page under the General tab in the contacts record, it will say 'Above contact is
					X of the payer'.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>When you complete the enrolment, the changes will be saved. If you cancel the
					enrolment, your changes will not be saved.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<section>
			<title>Simple enrolments</title>
			<para>The most important thing to remember about Quick Enrol is that all enrolments
				processed in a single onCourse Quick Enrol process generate one invoice to a single
				payer. This could be for one student enrolling and paying for themselves in one or
				more classes, or another contact enrolling and paying for one or more students to
				enrol in one or more classes. If two friends are enrolling in a class together and
				paying separately, you would process their enrolments as two separate Quick Enrol
				processes.</para>
			<para>Every Quick Enrol process generates an invoice, even if there is no payment
				involved. Sometimes, this invoice will be for $0.00, for example if there is no cost
				to enrol in the selected class. Sometimes the invoice will be paid in full on
				enrolment, and also be a receipt of payment. Sometimes the invoice will be partially
				paid or not paid at all. The default setting for Quick Enrol to default payments to
				full payment or no payment is set in the Financial Preferences window.</para>
			<para>When processing an enrolment via the onCourse client, it is possible to issue an
				invoice to the customer who won't be paying the course fee at the time of enrolment,
				even if your usual preference is set to pay in full. This is done by changing the
				payment method to 'no payment' from the default option 'credit card'.</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Open "Quick Enrol"</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>In the "Enter contact..." field, type in a name of the contact you are
						trying to enrol. If the correct contact populates on the right hand window,
						then select them, if the person you need is not in the system, you can
						create their profile by clicking on the 'Select' button on the right hand
						side on the window next to the text 'New contact' and then complete their
						contact detail information.</para>

					</mediaobject>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>After the contact is selected, click on the "Enter course or item" field
						on the left hand side.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>From here input either a course code or course name, again these fields
						are autocomplete so if you were to type e.g "Comp", courses that begin with
						those letters, e.g. 'Computers for Beginners', 'Computers for Seniors' will
						be available to select. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once the course is located then selected, the classes will be presented to
						you in the "Choose a class" list view, highlight the class you want. By
						default, only current and future classes will be shown.</para>
					<para>The "Show finished classes" checkbox can be selected to include classes
						that are now past their end date, e.g "Computers - Beginners ABC-123" is
						scheduled to end on 24/11/13, and the date is 25/11/13, selecting "Show
						finished classes" ensures that "Computers - Beginners ACBC-123" is shown in
						the class list view and can be selected for enrolment.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>You can now add a MEMBERSHIP, VOUCHER, or PRODUCT, if other purchases are
						being made with this enrolment. This can be done by either searching for a
						membership number or name; voucher code; or a product name, or alternatively
						clicking on one of the 'Show all' buttons on the right hand side of the
						page.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If you wish to review the invoice, you can so this by clicking on the
						'ITEMS' button</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If you have either a voucher or promotion code you can input this into the
						'Enter voucher or promotion...' field, then click on the + symbol to
						apply</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>You can now review the invoice/s the payment will apply to by clicking on
						the PAYMENTS button on the left hand side of the page. This only is
						necessary if the student has previous invoices with balances outstanding.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Next, select the Credit card button from the left hand side to select the
						chosen payment method; the payment amount; and who the payer will be. Please
						note that the payer does not have to be the student, it can be any other
						contact added to the Quick Enrol process, including a company.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Finally, select save from the bottom of the window, a confirmation box
						will appear, form here select your methods of receiving the invoice and
						enrolment confirmation. That's it!</para>

			<title>Discounting the enrolment fee</title>
			<itemizedlist>
				<title>When processing an enrolment through Quick Enrol, you can discount course
					fees by using:</title>
				<listitem>
					<para>Automatic discount â€“ a discount automatically offered to people who meet
						pre-defined criteria, e.g. seniors, people who hold a certain membership,
						students re-enrolling within a defined time period or students enrolling in
						a defined date range</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>

						promotion or concession</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para> More about concessions and promotions can be found in <xref
					xlink:href="#discounts"/></para>
			<para> If an automatic discount has been created, the student meets the requirements of
				the discount and the class they are enrolling in has been set to allow that type of
				discount, then the discount will automatically be applied when they enrol. </para>
			<para>If a student is automatically eligible for more than one type of discount, the
				higher discount will be applied.</para>

			<title>Enrolling a student in credit or debt</title>
			<para>To enrol a student in credit or debt basically means that the student (when the
				student is the payer) you are about to enrol owes your organisation money through
				unpaid or partially paid fees, or your organisation owes this student money via an
				onCourse credit note, perhaps because the student cancelled an enrolment in a prior
				class. To achieve one of these you would need to make sure the following:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>The student must have been previously enrolled in a class.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The student must have accrued either credit or debit depending on their
						previous engagements with your organisation.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once trying to enrol the student, you will notice the amount either in
						"Previous owing" or "Balance outstanding". </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If the student has credit to their name, then the balance outstanding will
						be less than cost of the enrolment. The student may use all or some of their
						credit during this enrolment. If the student has insufficient credit
						available to cover the cost of this enrolment, they can pay the balance
						outstanding as per a standard enrolment.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If the student has a debt, and your financial preferences are to pay the
						enrolment in full, then the default payment amount will be the total they
						owe. As per the previous section 'How to review a contact's invoices', you
						can choose which, if any, of the outstanding invoices you wish to pay
						now.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Keep in mind the outstanding balance in any Quick Enrol will be the
						balance of the payer's account. For many enrolments, the payer and student
						are the same person. However, if the payer is another person or company,
						their credit can be used to pay for another student's enrolment. </para>

		<title>Quick Enrol payment options</title>
		<para>By default the first contact is nominated as the payer. If you wish to switch this to
			another contact, click on the payment button on the left and change the name of the
			payer in the field provided. You can also change who the payer is by clicking on the
			ITEMS button on the left side of the page.</para>
		<para>If a third party, such as an employer or agency are paying the fee, and if the payer
			has any amount outstanding, that information will be added to the total fee. You can
			choose to pay the full amount owing, zero, or a portion of the amount owing. </para>
		<para>If a voucher is being used to pay for an enrolment, you need to add the voucher before
			choosing how to pay any balance outstanding by an alternate method.</para>
		<para>If your financial preferences are set to pay in full, but you are taking a partial
			payment now, you can edit the amount the contact wants to pay at this time by clicking

			feel free to post a question in our forum or lodge an onCourse support request.</para>
		<section>
			<title>How do I manage an overpayment made by a student? </title>
			<para>onCourse does not allow overpayments of invoices. This is a deliberate design
				function to ensure data entry errors are not made. If a student presents a cheque
				made out for the wrong amount, so you can bank and process the cheque you can do the
				following:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create the enrolment as usual in Quick Enrol</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Add an 'other charge' to the enrolment, with a line item title like
						'overpayment'</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Process the payment in Quick Enrol with the total balance of the cheque
						that has been presented.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> Go to Invoices and create a manual credit note for the person who made an
						overpayment. This credit can then be used towards other enrolments or
						refunded. </para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>What do I do if I have recorded a payment (money) without any payment actually
				being made or I recorded the wrong amount?</title>
			<para>If for example a student has not actually made a physical payment on their
				enrolment, but an onCourse user recorded their enrolment in onCourse as paid, you
				will need to follow these steps to resolve it. Only unreconciled payments can be
				reversed.</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Locate the payment record in the 'Payment in' window and select it by
						single clicking it</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>In the to right hand corner or the window, go to the cogwheel and select
						the option 'Reverse payment'. This will reverse the payment against the
						invoice(s) where it was originally applied. Those invoices will now have a
						balance outstanding.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>When you complete the reversal process, the status of the payment in will
						change from success to reversed.</para>

		<section>
			<title>How do I change part of an enrolment fee to a business, and part to a student? </title>
			<para>The best way to charge part of an enrolment fee to someone and another part to
				someone else would be to follow these steps. We will use an example of a $100
				enrolment where a student has paid half of an enrolment and the other half has been
				paid for by their job network agency:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a credit note for the student for $50 (half of the class fee). This
						will now drop their balance outstanding down to $50 (or $0 if they have
						already paid their half)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a manual invoice for the job network agency in the invoice window
						for the remaining $50.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Process the payment in for Job network invoice when they pay it. </para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>For an invoice, you can not record some of the payment coming from a person other
				than the payer (in this case the student). The reason you would use this method is
				so that if the student's enrolment is cancelled for some reason, they will only be
				entitled to a $50 refund, rather than the full $100. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>How do I provide an student with a discount after they have already
				enrolled?</title>
			<para>Invoices in onCourse are immutable, that is, you can't change them after they have
				already been issued.</para>
			<para>You can choose to either cancel the original enrolment and process it again
				correctly, with the discount or you can create a manual credit note for the
				student</para>
			<para>If the student has already paid the full amount, they will end up with credit that
				can be refunded or used towards another enrolment. If the student hasn't paid
				against the original invoice, they will now have a lower balance due, because of
				their credit note.</para>
		</section>
	<section>
		<title>How do I check to see if a student has been enrolled?</title>
		<para>You can go to the Enrolment list view window that will allow you to see basic information
				about all enrolments taken both in the office and on the web.</para>
		<para>If you require more information about an individual enrolment you can double click on an
				record; this will open a new window with additional information broken down into 4
				tabs. These tabs are General, Outcomes, VET FEE-HELP and Attachments</para>

			<title>What happens if a student doesn't meet the class age restrictions?</title>
			<para>If a class has a minimum, maximum or age range set for enrolment in the class
				general tab, then during Quick Enrol, each student attempting to enrol in the class
				will have their date of birth checked.</para>
			<para>If the student doesn't have a date of birth at all, then they will not be allowed
				to enrol until a valid date of birth is provided.</para>
			<para>If the student has a date of birth that means they do not meet the age
				requirements, they will not be able to enrol.</para>
			<para>If the student is enrolling via the office, then their date of birth can be
				modified. If the student is self enrolling on the website, and has previously
				provided their date of birth, they can not change their date of birth without
				contacting the office. If you approve and change their date birth in onCourse, they
				will then be allowed to enrol in this class on the website.</para>
