		<title>Creating an enrolment with Checkout</title>
		<para>This section will provide you with clear and concise instructions on how to achieve certain
			things within onCourse Checkout, like enrolling a student.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<title>A few things to consider first</title>
			<listitem>
				<para>A contact can be a student or a payer, a company can be listed as a payer but
					can not be a student. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Student names can be entered in this fashion: "Smith, John". When you type a
					comma, the auto complete looks up all students with "Smith" as a surname. As you
					continue to type letters of the first name, the list is reduced. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>You can also type student names like this: "John Smith". When you do this, the
					auto complete feature will not start showing you choices until you have typed a
					few letters of the student's surname. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If the student you are enrolling has a contact record at your college, you can
					select them from the list on the right hand side of the window. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>When searching for a students record a list will appear on the right of the
					window, you will see their full name, suburb, date of birth and email address,
					to assist you in selecting the right record.</para>
				<note>
					<para>The USI field will be disabled along with you not being able to change student name of
						date of birth, in Checkout, if the USI has been verified.</para>
				</note>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If the student you wish to enrol is new to your college, you can select the option "New
					contact..." which will appear on the right hand window when you click on the
					'Enter contact...' field.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Once you have selected your student, you will see their information in the Checkout
					window, this is the same information you see in their contact record, you can
					then make changes to any of the contact details, notes or AVETMISS information
					as needed. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If there is a third party payer you will need to add them as a contact and
					create a relationship to the student. This can be found at the bottom of the
					page under the General tab in the contacts record, it will say 'Above contact is
					X of the payer'.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>When you complete the enrolment, the changes will be saved. If you cancel the
					enrolment, your changes will not be saved.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<section>
			<title>Simple enrolments</title>
			<para>The most important thing to remember about Checkout is that all enrolments processed in a
				single onCourse Checkout process generate one invoice to a single payer. This could
				be for one student enrolling and paying for themselves in one or more classes, or
				another contact enrolling and paying for one or more students to enrol in one or
				more classes. If two friends are enrolling in a class together and paying
				separately, you would process their enrolments as two separate Checkout
				processes.</para>
			<para>Every Checkout process generates an invoice, even if there is no payment involved.
				Sometimes, this invoice will be for $0.00, for example if there is no cost to enrol
				in the selected class. Sometimes the invoice will be paid in full on enrolment, and
				also be a receipt of payment. Sometimes the invoice will be partially paid or not
				paid at all. The default setting for Checkout to default payments to full payment or
				no payment is set in the Financial Preferences window.</para>
			<para>When processing an enrolment via the onCourse client, it is possible to issue an
				invoice to the customer who won't be paying the course fee at the time of enrolment,
				even if your usual preference is set to pay in full. This is done by changing the
				payment method to 'no payment' from the default option 'credit card'.</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Open "Checkout"</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>In the "Enter contact..." field, type in a name of the contact you are
						trying to enrol. If the correct contact populates on the right hand window,
						then select them, if the person you need is not in the system, you can
						create their profile by clicking on the 'Select' button on the right hand
						side on the window next to the text 'New contact' and then complete their
						contact detail information.</para>

					<para>After the contact is selected, click on the "Enter course or item" field
						on the left hand side.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>From here input either a course code or course name, again these fields
						are auto complete so if you were to type e.g. "Comp", courses that begin with
						those letters, e.g. 'Computers for Beginners', 'Computers for Seniors' will
						be available to select. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once the course is located then selected, the classes will be presented to
						you in the "Choose a class" list view, highlight the class you want. By
						default, only current and future classes will be shown.</para>
					<para>The "Show finished classes" checkbox can be selected to include classes
						that are now past their end date, e.g. "Computers - Beginners ABC-123" is
						scheduled to end on 24/11/13, and the date is 25/11/13, selecting "Show
						finished classes" ensures that "Computers - Beginners ACBC-123" is shown in
						the class list view and can be selected for enrolment.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>You can now add a MEMBERSHIP, VOUCHER, or PRODUCT, if other purchases are
						being made with this enrolment. This can be done by either searching for a
						membership number or name; voucher code; or a product name, or alternatively
						clicking on one of the 'Show all' buttons on the right hand side of the
						page.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If you wish to review the invoice, you can so this by clicking on the
						'ITEMS' button</para>

					<para>If you have either a voucher or promotion code you can input this into the
						'Enter voucher or promotion...' field, then click on the + symbol to
						apply</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>You can now review the invoice/s the payment will apply to by clicking on
						the PAYMENTS button on the left hand side of the page. This only is
						necessary if the student has previous invoices with balances outstanding.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Next, select the Credit card button from the left hand side to select the chosen payment
						method; the payment amount; and who the payer will be. Please note that the
						payer does not have to be the student, it can be any other contact added to
						the Checkout process, including a company.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Finally, select save from the bottom of the window, a confirmation box
						will appear, form here select your methods of receiving the invoice and
						enrolment confirmation. That's it!</para>

			<title>Discounting the enrolment fee</title>
			<itemizedlist>
				<title>When processing an enrolment through Checkout, you can discount course fees by
					using:</title>
				<listitem>
					<para>Automatic discount - a discount automatically offered to people who meet pre-defined
						criteria, e.g. seniors, people who hold a certain membership, students
						re-enrolling within a defined time period or students enrolling in a defined

				the discount and the class they are enrolling in has been set to allow that type of
				discount, then the discount will automatically be applied when they enrol. </para>

			<title>Enrolling a student in credit or debt</title>
			<para>To enrol a student in credit or debt basically means that the student (when the
				student is the payer) you are about to enrol owes your organisation money through
				unpaid or partially paid fees, or your organisation owes this student money via an
				onCourse credit note, perhaps because the student cancelled an enrolment in a prior
				class. To achieve one of these you would need to make sure the following:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>The student must have been previously enrolled in a class.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>The student must have accrued either credit or debit depending on their
						previous engagements with your organisation.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once trying to enrol the student, you will notice the amount either in
						"Previous owing" or "Balance outstanding". </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If the student has credit to their name, then the balance outstanding will
						be less than cost of the enrolment. The student may use all or some of their
						credit during this enrolment. If the student has insufficient credit
						available to cover the cost of this enrolment, they can pay the balance
						outstanding as per a standard enrolment.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>If the student has a debt, and your financial preferences are to pay the
						enrolment in full, then the default payment amount will be the total they
						owe. As per the previous section 'How to review a contact's invoices', you
						can choose which, if any, of the outstanding invoices you wish to pay
						now.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Keep in mind the outstanding balance in any Checkout will be the balance of the payer's
						account. For many enrolments, the payer and student are the same person.
						However, if the payer is another person or company, their credit can be used
						to pay for another student's enrolment. </para>

			<title>What do I do if I have recorded a payment (money) without any payment actually
				being made or I recorded the wrong amount?</title>
			<para>If for example a student has not actually made a physical payment on their
				enrolment, but an onCourse user recorded their enrolment in onCourse as paid, you
				will need to follow these steps to resolve it. Only unreconciled payments can be
				reversed.</para>

					<para>Locate the payment record in the 'Payment in' window and select it by

					<para>In the to right hand corner or the window, go to the cogwheel and select

			<title>How do I change part of an enrolment fee to a business, and part to a student? </title>
			<para>The best way to charge part of an enrolment fee to someone and another part to
				someone else would be to follow these steps. We will use an example of a $100
				enrolment where a student has paid half of an enrolment and the other half has been
				paid for by their job network agency:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a credit note for the student for $50 (half of the class fee). This
						will now drop their balance outstanding down to $50 (or $0 if they have
						already paid their half)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a manual invoice for the job network agency in the invoice window
						for the remaining $50.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Process the payment in for Job network invoice when they pay it. </para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>For an invoice, you can not record some of the payment coming from a person other
				than the payer (in this case the student). The reason you would use this method is
				so that if the student's enrolment is cancelled for some reason, they will only be
				entitled to a $50 refund, rather than the full $100. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>How do I provide a student with a discount after they have already enrolled?</title>
			<para>Invoices in onCourse are immutable; you can't change them after they have already been
				issued.</para>
			<para>You can choose to either cancel the original enrolment and process it again
				correctly, with the discount or you can create a manual credit note for the
				student</para>
			<para>If the student has already paid the full amount, they will end up with credit that
				can be refunded or used towards another enrolment. If the student hasn't paid
				against the original invoice, they will now have a lower balance due, because of
				their credit note.</para>
		</section>
	<section>
		<title>How do I check to see if a student has been enrolled?</title>
		<para>You can go to the Enrolment list view window and type the student's name into the basic
				search. Double-click on the record to open it and view it in more detail.</para>
		<para>If you require more information about an individual enrolment you can double click on an
				record; this will open a new window with additional information broken down into 4
				tabs. These tabs are General, Outcomes, VET FEE-HELP and Attachments</para>

			<title>What happens if a student doesn't meet the class age restrictions?</title>
			<para>If a class has a minimum, maximum or age range set for enrolment in the class general tab,
				then during Checkout, each student attempting to enrol in the class will have their
				date of birth checked.</para>
			<para>If the student doesn't have a date of birth at all, then they will not be allowed
				to enrol until a valid date of birth is provided.</para>
			<para>If the student has a date of birth that means they do not meet the age
				requirements, they will not be able to enrol.</para>
			<para>If the student is enrolling via the office, then their date of birth can be
				modified. If the student is self enrolling on the website, and has previously
				provided their date of birth, they can not change their date of birth without
				contacting the office. If you approve and change their date birth in onCourse, they
				will then be allowed to enrol in this class on the website.</para>
