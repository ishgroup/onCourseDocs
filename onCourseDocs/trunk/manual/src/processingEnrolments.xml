			things within onCourse Quick Enrol, like enrolling a student.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<title>A few things to consider first</title>
			<listitem>
				<para>A contact can be a student or a payer, a company can be listed as a payer but can not
					be a student. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Student names can be entered in this fashion: "Smith, John". When you type a comma, the
					auto complete looks up all students with "Smith" as a surname. As you continue
					to type letters of the first name, the list is reduced. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>You can also type student names like this: "John Smith". When you do this, the auto
					complete feature will not start showing you choices until you have typed a few
					letters of the student's surname. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>At any time you can press the up and down arrows on your keyboard to select a student,
					and press 'return' to choose the student currently selected. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If the student you are enrolling has a contact record at your college, you can select
					them from the list. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>When the student name is highlighted in the list, you will see their suburb and date
					of birth, to assist you in selecting the right record.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>If the student you wish to enrol is new to your college, you can select the option
					"Newâ€¦" from the list to begin creating a new student record.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Once you have selected your student, you will see their information in the Quick Enrol
					window, this is the same information you see in their contact record, you can then make
					changes to any of the contact details, notes or AVETMISS information as needed. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>A third party payer is a person or organisation who is not the student enrolling. This
					can include other students, friends, relatives, managers, organisations.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>When you complete the enrolment, the changes will be saved. If you cancel the
					enrolment, your changes will not be saved.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<tip>
			<para>Please note that once you open Quick Enrol, you will be defaulted to the <emphasis
					role="bold">enter enrolment</emphasis> page, you do not have to start the enrolment
				process from this page, you may start from anywhere in Quick Enrol, although it is
				recommended to start at "enter contact", as this will make things simpler.</para>

			<title>How to use Quick Enrol to create an enrolment and issue an invoice</title>
			<para>When processing an enrolment via the onCourse client, it is possible to issue an invoice
				if the customer does not wish to pay the course fee at the point of enrolment. The following
				will take you through the enrolment process when an invoice is issued step by step, keeping
				it simple throughout.</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Open "Quick Enrol", see above for instructions.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>You are defaulted to the "Enter Enrolment" page, from the left select "Enter
						contact".</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>In the "name" field, type in a name and click on it to select that person and
						populate the fields with their details (autofill), if the person you need is not in the
						system, you can create their profile from here, by filling out the fields and selecting
						either "Student", "Tutor" or "Company", depending on who they are (payer or student
						etc).</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>After the contact is selected, click on "Enter Enrolment" from the left hand
						side.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>From here input either a course code or course name, again these fields are
						autocomplete so if you were to type e.g "Comp", the rest of the word "Computer" will
						come up showing courses that contain that word in the title.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once the course is located in the system, the classes will be presented to you in
						the "Choose a class" list view, highlight the class you want, remembering that the "Show
						finished classes" checkbox can be selected to include classes that are now past their
						end date, e.g "Computers - For Beginners" is scheduled to end on 24/11/11, and the date
						is 25/11/11, selecting "Show finished classes" ensures that "Computers- For Beginners"
						is shown in the class list view.</para>

						instructions).</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>As the payment will not be made at the time of enrolment, enter $0 amount in the
						payment amount field, the system will then allow you to finalise the enrolment without
						selecting a payment type. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Finally, select save from the bottom of the window, a confirmation box will appear,
						form here select your methods of receiving the invoice and enrolment confirmation.

				student, each of the contacts will be created with a copy of the first contact's enrolments.
				For example, if three friends are all enrolling in the same two dance classes, add the
				enrolments to the first person, then add your other two contacts and they will be populated
				with the same classes. If you have students enrolling together that are doing different
				classes, e.g. a husband enrolling in painting and a wife enrolling in Tai Chi, add both
				contacts first, then add the enrolments to each contact. There are small crosses on the
				right hand side of the screen that allow you to remove contacts or enrolments you don't
				need. </para>

			<title>Enrolling a student in credit or debt</title>

			<title>What do you do if you have recorded a payment (income) without any payment actually
				being made?</title>
			<para>If for example a student has not actually given any details or handed over cash to you,
				but someone from admin has recorded this in onCourse as payed, you will need to follow these
				steps to resolve it:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a credit note for the student for the amount incorrectly recorded as paid
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a payment out for the student for the full amount, for the same method as the
						original payment in was recorded as (e.g. EFT) </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a new invoice for the student for the amount owing. Leave this invoice as
						unpaid. </para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>If the student has paid (by the method as originally recorded) then nothing needs to be
				done in onCourse, except to perhaps attach a private note to the invoice to state that the
				payment was recorded on the wrong date</para>
			<para> If the student has paid but now by a different method, then the steps above need to be
				followed, with the added step of creating a new "payment in" record for the correct payment
				method. </para>

			<title>How do I charge a cancellation fee after I have created the credit note for the full
				amount paid? </title>
			<para>The credit note and outstanding balance on an invoice will cancel each other out. If you
				try typing the payers name into quick enrol, you should find that there will be a total
				balance of zero, also, on the printed Debtors report, there will be a balance of zero, so
				this will not affect any future enrolments you make.</para>
			<para>An alternative option to creating an 'other charge' in quick enrol, is to click on the +
				button in the top hand corner of the invoice list view to create a manual invoice (or in
				this case, a credit note), but either way this produces the same result. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>How do I change part of an enrolment fee to a business, and part to a student? </title>
			<para>The best way to charge part of an enrolment fee to someone and another part to someone
				else would be to follow these steps, we will use an example a student who has paid half of
				an enrolment and the other half has been paid for by their job network agency:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a credit note for the student for 50% of the class fee. This will now drop
						their balance outstanding down to 50% (or $0 if they have already paid their 50%)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a manual invoice for the job network agency using the method described
						above.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Process the payment in for Job network invoice when they pay it. </para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>For an invoice, you can not record some of the payment coming from a person other than
				the payer (in this case the student). In the future you will also need to do this manually,
				so two invoices are issued, each for half the value of the enrolment fee. You might do this
				by giving the student a 50% discount on enrolment (and then issuing a manual invoice to the
				job network) or by doing the method outlined above and creating the credit note for the
				student post enrolment. </para>

		<title>Tax invoices and enrolment confirmations</title>
		<para>If the student(s) have provided email addresses, you can choose to send this information
			now. Otherwise, it can be printed at a later date. Select for each student if you would like
			this information emailed and/or mailed. </para>
		<para>The enrolment confirmation goes to each student who has enrolled in a class. The tax
			invoice only goes to the payer. For example, if two friends were attending a class together,
			paid for by one of them as a gift to the other, only the payer would receive information about
			the fees charged. The person receiving the enrolment as a gift would simply receive an
			enrolment confirmation with no information regarding the cost. </para>
		<para>Press save to process, and save the enrolment. The completed enrolment will be visible as
			â€˜Active' in the Enrolment window. If the save button is greyed out, it means you have not
			entered all the required information. Look for the yellow Attention signs and pink fields to
			know where the error is coming from, also you can hover over the yellow attention signs for a
			brief explanation as to what may be causing the error.</para>
