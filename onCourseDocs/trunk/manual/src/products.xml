    <para>A range of products can be sold through onCourse. You have already seen how you can create
        classes and open them for enrolment at any price you set. In addition to enrolments in
        classes you can also sell:</para>
    <para>

    <para>In this chapter we'll focus on the last of these items: product sales. For more
        information on memberships, see <link xlink:href="concessions.html">the concessions and

    <para>Products in onCourse are a simple way to supply additional, defined items during an
        enrolment sale. onCourse does not manage a stock inventory or the shipping of products. It
        is expected that most products will be supplied to the student in person when they attend
        the class.</para>
