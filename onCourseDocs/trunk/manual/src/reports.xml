	<subtitle>Reports. Numbers. Charts. It's important to be able see your data to make business
		decisions, and even more importantly, seeing it in a way that makes sense to you.</subtitle>
	<section xml:id="reports-existing">
		<title>Existing reports</title>
		<para>In onCourse, we have used a powerful, flexible reporting engine called JasperReports to
			create our reports. We and our customers can create report templates are used to generate
			print quality output PDF, CSV and XML that fits their needs.</para>
		<para>There exist a number of tools that can be used to create custom reports which are outlined
			in the later sections of this document. Our tool of choice is called iReport, but it's still
			possible to create reports such as OpenOffice or MS Office but these solutions will not be
			able to generate reports that can be imported as a report within onCourse itself.</para>
		<para>You'll find that a number of reports have already been included in onCourse. For the most
			part these will provide information about one thing, ie. from the Students window, you'll be
			able to print a list of students, or student details. Similarly from the Courses window, you
			can reports relating to courses.</para>
		<para>However, sometimes onCourse users want to find out more information than is included in
			current reports. We also have a mechanism to create custom reports, and import theses reports
			that into onCourse, allowing new reports to be printed when required. Alternatively, you can
			contract ish to develop custom reports to meet your specifications.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Printing Reports in onCourse</title>
			<para>The first thing to be aware of when attempting to print a report is that you must be in
				the right onCourse list view to print a report. For example, Class roll is a report
				available from the class list. You can not print this report from inside the class record,
				or from the general window. You must open the class window first.</para>
			<para>From each list window, you can select File > Print to see the list of available
				reports.</para>
			<para>All reports are printed to a PDF file which you can save to your computer, email, or print
				to a printer on your network. Your computer will need to have a PDF reader installed
				to create and view the report. Windows operating systems prior to Windows 8 need to
				have this manually installed as one is not included as part of the operating system.
				OSX includes an embedded PDF reader called Preview. </para>
			<para> For exports to excel, XML or other formats, see the chapter <link
					xlink:href="#importExport">Importing and Exporting.</link>
			</para>
			<para>Before you print a report, you will usually need to run a query on the data first. For
				example, if you wish to print the class rolls for all the classes starting this week, you
				will need to do an advanced query for classes starting from today, to the last day of the
				week. For more information on queries, see the chapter Getting Started.</para>
			<para>The print dialogue box provides an alphabetized list of all reports available via the given
				window, simply select the relevant report and a summary description is provided of
				the highlighted report. This description will also clarify as to whether the report
				prints in Portrait or Landscape format.</para>
			<para>In the print dialogue, you will be asked if you want to print all, selected or
				highlighted records. A record count will be given for each option. Selecting 'all' will
				print the report for all records in the database. Choosing 'selected' will print the results
				from the query you have run. Choosing highlighted will print the report for the one or more
				records you have selected in the list. </para>
			<section>
				<title>Managing Print Backgrounds </title>
				<para>onCourse printed reports can be set up with a defined background or overlay allowing the
					user to utilise different backgrounds or headers dependent upon the particular
					report. These backgrounds can be set up as a PDF document that is then imported
					into onCourse via the report window. </para>
				<para>Generally, a college will have a standard 'letterhead' style background,
					available in both portrait and landscape modes that can be used as the print
					background to common reports like invoices, enrolment confirmations and class
					rolls.</para>
				<para>In addition, the college may have one or more background reports for their
					Qualification, Statement of Attainment, Transcript and Certificate of Attendance
					reports. These backgrounds will usually contain formal elements such the
					colleges contact details, RTO ID, the business logo, the AQF and/or NRT logos
					and possibly the certificate signatory details &amp; signature. They also may
					contain optional design elements such as borders, background images or
					watermarks.</para>
				<para>By using the background function for activities such as certificate printing
					design, with only the text based contents coming from the onCourse report, a
					college can modify their backgrounds at any time,without access to sophisticated
					software or report writing skills.</para>
				<section>
					<title>Setting Up the Report Print Backgrounds</title>
				<para>The following instructions outline how you can set up your report print backgrounds which
						will be overlayed with the report content:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create a new Microsoft Word or iWork Pages document and ensure that the page set up is set to Portrait.</para>					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Open up the Header for the new document and place the required logo and contact details you wish the report to display.</para>
				<tip>
					<para>Ensure that the elements that you place within the header do not exceed the dimensions of
									the report header space. </para>
				</tip>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once you have completed the set up of the page header, save the document as a PDF so that
								it is ready to be imported into onCourse as a background. Make sure
								that you clearly label within the name of the PDF whether the
								document is Portrait or Landscape format. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Reset the original Word or Pages document to display in Landscape format, then realign
								the elements within Header to ensure it fits within the dimensions
								of the Header.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Repeat step 3 making sure that you clearly label within the name of the PDF whether the
							document is Portrait or Landscape format</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Certificate Backgrounds</title>
					<para>The standard Qualification and Statement of Attainment reports include a
						second report, the transcript, as the second page.</para>
					<para>If you already have a certificate background you have had professionally
						designed, which you order from the printers, you can choose to embed this
						background in the report. You should request a A4 PDF of your backgrounds
						from your designers first.</para>
					<para>If you do not have a professionally designed background, you can easily create your own
						using a simple word processing tool.  Keep in mind the <link
							xlink:href="http://www.asqa.gov.au/qualifications/issuing-qualifications.html"
							> ASQA guidelines for issuing certificates</link> and the appropriate
						use of the formal logos, when designing your backgrounds.</para>
					<para>You will also need a second page PDF background for the transcript
						report.</para>
					<para>If you create and upload a two page PDF, comprised of your Certificate design followed by
						your letterhead or transcript design, for example, these pages will be used
						correctly when printing the combined report from onCourse.</para>
					<para>When creating a background for a Qualification or Statement of Attainment report,
						onCourse will apply the first page of your PDF background to the first page
						of your report (the Certificate page), then apply the second page of your
						PDF background to each subsequent page of the Certificate report (the
						Transcript pages).  </para>
				<para>If you are printing Certificates in bulk, onCourse will recognise when the student record
						has changed to the next student and therefore apply the first page of the
						PDF background again as this is a new Certificate. </para>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Selecting a Background when Running the Report</title>
					<para>Once you have created the print backgrounds for your reports, you can now import those
						PDF backgrounds into onCourse and attach them to the specific report. You
						only need to import each report background once. </para>
					<para>Selecting the relevant background is managed via the print dialogue box of
						onCourse. The following instructions outline how you can apply the relevant
						backgrounds to your reports:</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>The first option within the drop down menu of available backgrounds is 'no background'.
								If you select this option it simply means that the header of the
								report will be blank (no logos or text will appear).</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>The drop down menu will also display any other backgrounds that you have previously
								imported into onCourse. As per the following example, this is where
								the naming convention of the backgrounds becomes very important,
								particularly with respect to whether the background is in Portrait
								or Landscape format. If you select a Landscape template for a report
								which is printed in Portrait format, the report will not work. </para>
							<mediaobject>
								<imageobject>
									<imagedata contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/PrintBackgroundOptions.png" format="png" scalefit="1" width="100%"/>
								</imageobject>
								<caption>
									<para>Select the relevant print background from the drop down menu</para>
								</caption>
							</mediaobject>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>If you wish to import a new background PDF document, select 'import from disk' from the
								drop down menu, this will bring up a dialogue box to allow you to
								select the background you wish to use for this report. Note also
								that the newly imported print background will be auto selected as
								the background for the Report you are currently running by default. </para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Once you have either selected an existing background or imported a new one from disk, you simply run the report, which will generate a PDF output of the report with the specified background.</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>
					<tip>
						<para>The chosen report will display the last background used as the default when printing
							that report. But you can simply select an alternate background from
							the drop down menu or import a new background if you so chose.  </para></tip>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Managing Print Backgrounds</title>
					<para>Once you have uploaded the PDF documents that become the print backgrounds for your
						reports, you can then manage these backgrounds via the Report window of
						onCourse.</para>
					<para>To access these backgrounds go to <guimenuitem> File - Preferences -
							Reports</guimenuitem>, highlight the report you wish to edit the
						background or backgrounds for then select 'Manage print backgrounds' via the
						cogwheel icon of the Report window.</para>
					<mediaobject>
						<imageobject>
							<imagedata contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/ManagePrintBackgroundsViaCogwheel.png" format="png" scalefit="1" width="100%"/>
						</imageobject>
						<caption>
							<para>Manage backgrounds via Report window</para>
						</caption>
					</mediaobject>
					<para>A new dialogue box will appear, which allows you to either rename a background by double
						clicking on the entry, or to delete a background that is no longer being
						utilised. </para>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/ManagePrintBackgroundsDialogueBox.png" format="png" scalefit="1" width="100%"/>

						<para>Editing Backgrounds</para>
					</caption>
				</mediaobject>
					<tip>
						<para>You can only import new backgrounds via the Print dialogue box when printing a given
							report. This process cannot be done via the Report window of
							onCourse.</para>
					</tip>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Managing Backgrounds for Custom Reports</title>
					<para>The ability to apply a print background to your Custom Reports provides users with a much greater level of flexibility particularly in reference to generating Certificates. </para>
					<para>One example of this is that if your College has more than one entity such as a separate
						Business Training College, by setting up different print backgrounds for
						each of your entities, including logos and branding, you can manage the
						generation of certificates for both entities with ease. Whereas previously
						the images were embedded within the Custom Report itself, these images are
						now part of the print background. </para>
					<para>You can also apply new backgrounds to your Custom Reports without the need to contact ish
						to request changes to your Custom Report, you can simply manage this by
						updating the print background that is used for the relevant custom
						report.</para>
					<para>Further to this, you can update the signatory name for your Certificate reports via the
						AVETMISS tab / General Preferences settings of onCourse. Remember that this
						field will appear as one line on your Certificate report, so you would add
						the name and title of the nominated signatory name in the one line. Go to
							<guimenuitem> File - Preferences - General Preferences</guimenuitem>and
						click on the AVETMISS tab, the 'Full certificate signatory name' field you
						need to edit is under 'Optional' on this tab. Whatever content you add to
						this field, will appear automatically within your Certificate Reports,
						unless your custom report has this information hard coded into it.</para>
					<para>If you require a different layout for the signatory fields i.e. two names,
						name and title on separate lines or embedded digital signature, we recommend
						you put all this data in the background and remove the signatory details
						from the onCourse report template.</para>
					<mediaobject>

		<title>Developing custom reports</title>
		<para>Custom reports can be developed for onCourse by any user, or by ish on request, and then
			imported into onCourse via your client. Most custom reports will be quoted for development as
			this work is not part of the onCourse user support plan.</para>
		<section>
			<title>How to request the development of a custom report from ish</title>
			<para>If you have determined that there are no reports that currently exist inside of onCourse
				that meet your requirements, your next step is to mock up a report that you can provide to
				ish to show how and what you would like to see in a new report. </para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>If there is a similar report, describe how you want it changed e.g. what information
						needs to be added, where it needs to be added ect. Write this on a copy of the report
						and scan and send to ish </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>For a new report, mock up a sample (hand drawn or typed up) to provide to ish.
						Describe how the report works, where the information comes from, what data is included
						or excluded. We will then discuss with you how we can best achieve this report, and any
						conditions that may apply to generating the report data in the format you request. A
						final mock-up sample will be provided by ish for your approval.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>For most custom reports a quote will be provided. The quote needs to be approved
						before development can commence. Reports which are product suggestions only (not
						requiring a quote) will be scheduled for development at a time determined by ish.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>We assign to a developer to build and test the new report. This process can take
						between one week and a month, depending on the complexity of the report.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Some reports require changes to be made to the underlying onCourse product code.
						Where this is required, we will advise you in advance as this means the report will not
						be available to you until you have upgraded to the product version where the code
						changes were made.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Once we have conducted our internal testing, the report file is sent to your

			<title>The basics of creating your own custom reports</title>
			<para>onCourse uses <uri>Jasper</uri>, an open source tool to create reports. You can add your
				own custom reports to onCourse at any time by creating them with <uri
					xlink:href="http://jasperforge.org/projects/ireport">iReport</uri>. The current
				version we use to edit onCourse reports from version 4.1 and above is 5.0.1. You can
				download 5.0.1 <uri
					xlink:href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/wiki/ireport-501-release-notes"
					>here</uri> (If you are editing a report in an earlier version of onCourse you
				will need to use 4.0.1 which you can download <uri
					xlink:href="http://jasperforge.org/uploads/publish/ireportwebsite/IR%20Website/nb-4.0.1.html"
					>here</uri>) </para>
			<para>You can export existing onCourse reports to modify for your own organisation by going to
				File > Preferences > Reports and selecting the report you wish to edit. With the
				report highlighted in the list, go to the cog wheel option in the top right hand
				corner and select 'Save report file on disk'. This saved file will be the jrxml file
				you need to open in iReport to edit.</para>
			<para>Jasper report is a specially formatted text file. For ease of use the file can be edited
				with a visual editor called iReport.  The report file format is XML and this is
				a snippet from an example report file:</para>

		<section>
			<title>Report Properties</title>
			<para>onCourse expects to see certain properties added to each report. The properties can be edited in iReport using by choosing from the menu Edit->Custom properties or by just editing the XML by hand. If you look at the example above, you'll see all the common properties visible. At a minimum you need "keycode", "versionNumber" and "entity". Without these, your report will not be accepted by onCourse.</para>
			<para>A list of the onCourse special parameters:</para>
			<para>Other parameters which are compulsory are:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>keyCode - Each report has to be identified in the system, therefore it is given an unique
				property called 'keyCode'. We strongly recommend that for any reports you customise, you use a different
				code. This will avoid an update of onCourse software overriding your report with new version from our developers.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>versionNumber - a whole number, has to be increased every time a report is
						changed otherwise your modifications may not be visible.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>entity - identifies which is the starting point for the report, ie. report with
						value 'Certificate' will be available in print menu for list of certificates.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>isVisible - can only take value of 'true' or 'false', indicates whether the report
						is visible in the print dialog </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>isSubreport - some reports are just injected inside others, this allows to specify
						this fact and hide this report from the user choice</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>ish.oncourse.reports.following - use this property if you need print many reports as
						one, just add to this property a report's key (or keys). If you need put more then one
						key - separate keys with ";". Any reports in here will be automatically printed after the initial report. This is particularly useful for certificates.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>ish.oncourse.reports.isObjectOnSeparatePage - if this property is set, then each record is printed on a separate page. This is useful for invoices (for example) which should start a new page after every invoice record.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>ish.oncourse.title, ish.oncourse.filePrefix and ish.onCourse.pdfFileName are currently
				not used, but should be set to prevent future problems. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Using iReport</title>
			<para>This section cannot be summarised in few words, there are many online resources which
				will help you learn using iReport. A good starting point is <uri xlink:href="http://jasperforge.org/plugins/project/project_home.php?projectname=ireport">http://jasperforge.org/plugins/project/project_home.php?projectname=ireport</uri>
			</para>
			<para>There is one important thing to mention. onCourse utilises javaBean data source. This
				has its downsides, the report cannot be tested without importing it to onCourse. The
				database schema cannot be imported or read from iReport. But this is essential to assure
				security of the database and the data and prevent unauthorised access. </para>
			<para>For effective report writing a developer needs onCourse database schema. This document
				is available free of charge for all onCourse customers with support plan. </para>
			<para>The basic workflow for a report developer is:</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Create the report file </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Edit the report using iReport</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Compile it using iReport</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Import the report to onCourse</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Test it </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Repeat steps 2-5 until the report works as intended, updating the version number each
						time.</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>We discourage starting with iReport from creating brand new reports. It is much easier
				to start with tweaking the existing reports. (Remember though, that if you edit an existing
				report or template you need to give it a new keyCode property, otherwise the next time
				onCourse server is restarted it is going to be lost in the system).</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Using the data model</title>
			<para>When using iReport, you don't access the data directly. Instead you use the data model
				provided by the onCourse engine: this wraps up the database in a way that means you don't
				need to write SQL and you don't need to worry about which database you are using the
				backend. Derby, MySQL and MS-SQL will all work in exactly the same way. Accessing the data
				model is easy to do. First, <link xlink:href="http://cayenne.apache.org/download.html">download a tool</link> called "Cayenne Modeler": just grab the most recent stable build
				from that download page for your platform. You don't need to worry about the Cayenne
				libraries themselves, just run the modeler application. Next, you need a copy of the model
				itself for your version of onCourse. You can get this most easily by downloading the Linux
				onCourse Server installation (regardless of platform you are running, just grab that
				version). Then unzip and untar the onCourseServer.tar.gz file. Inside will be another file
				with a .jar extension. That is just another zip, so go ahead and unzip it (you may find it
				easier to rename .jar into .zip to fool your zip tool that it really is a zip file).
				Finally, amongst thousands of files which will be unzipped, use the Cayenne Modeler you
				installed earlier to open a file "cayenne/AngelMap.map.xml".</para>
			<para>What you now have open is the data model of onCourse itself. This ObjEntities
				represented by the icon which looks like "C" are the objects, attributes and relationships
				which the reports can access. As you look through some of the bundled reports that will
				become clearer.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Linking reports - creating custom certificate report example</title>
			<para>Sometimes a report has to be followed by another report. An example of this is printing
				certificates which according to the AVETMISS rules requires 3 parts: Qualification
				or Statement of Attainment, Statement of Attainment subreport followed by
				Transcript. OnCourse allows that by implementing an extra property key in the report
				ish.oncourse.reports.following="&lt;list of report keycodes separated by
				semicolon>". Upon printing of the report application checks for presence of that
				key, then if the listed reports exist in the database. All the listed reports will
				be printed one after another, based on the same selection of records.</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Importing a custom report</title>
		<para>Navigate to File > Preferences > Reports. From here you may click the + sign on the top
			right hand side and select "folder" or "single report". If you have more than one report to
			import, you can select "folder" is to import all the reports in a folder reports while the
			"single report" is to import just the one report.</para>
		<para>You can then be to select your report (.jrxml) from the location where it is saved on your
			computer. Select “open” button after highlighting the file (or folder) you want to
			import.</para>
		<para>You will then either get a message advising you that the import has been successful, or
			unsuccessful. If the import was unsuccessful, the most common reason is that the version
			number was not updated or the keycode was not made unique. onCourse will only recognise the
			report as a new report if it has a unique keycode, and will only update an exisiting report if
			the version number is higher than the version already in the product. You can check the values
			for these entries in the reports window inside onCourse.</para>

		<title>SQL Reporting with a JDBC connector</title>
		<section>
			<title>Using an SQL client with onCourse to write queries</title>
			<para>There are many reasons why you might want to access data in onCourse through a tool such as
				DBeaver. You might need to generate a custom report or export the result of a
				complex query to Excel and it's important to have full access to your data for that
				reason. </para>
			<para>Before you begin, you will need to have an SQL tool installed on your machine.</para>
			<para>DBeaver can be obtained from the <link xlink:href="http://dbeaver.jkiss.org"> DBeaver website.</link> </para>
			<para>Please note that support for SQL tools is not included as part of the standard onCourse
				support packages. This is self-service option available for people with strong IT
				skills and experience in working with relational databases to access the data within
				their onCourse database for their own purposes.</para>
			<para>If you are not familiar with these tools, we can provide these services for you as a
				custom quote.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
		<title>Setting DBeaver with the right JDBC to talk to onCourse</title>
			<para>When first openong DBeaver you will be asked to select your database type. Select the
				option 'Derby Server'. You will then be prompted to download the driver from their
				website. </para>
			<para>Once the drive has downloaded, in the new connection wizard select the option edit
				connection settings.</para>
			<para>You also must specify the sample URL. You need to enter jdbc:derby://&lt;server machine IP

			<title>Creating SQL queries</title>
			<para>If you are new to SQL a good place to start is <link xlink:href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp"> the w3schools SQL tutorial.</link>
				Once you have some familiarity with the structure of the onCourse database and the basics of
				SQL commands, you can then create queries requesting the information of your choice from the
				database.</para>
			<para>The most important part of constructing a query is understanding how the tables in onCourse
				join to each other so you can query across tables. You can access this information
				by following the instructions above about using the data model. You can also browse
				the tables, columns and data in onCourse through dBeaver by navigating to the
				onCourse > table. For each table you can browse the columns (field names) and the
				content (data from the database you have connected to). </para>
			<para>Most tables are joined via the ID field to the previous table. For example, in the
				contact table, you will see the ID column. In the student table you will see the column ID
				for the student record ID, and also the column CONTACTID which joins the student record to
				the contact record. If you want to return results about the names of students enrolled in
				classes you need to join the contact record (where the name of the person is) to the student
				record (who has enrolled in something) to the enrolment record (the join between the student
				and the class) and the class record (where the student enrolled) to the course record (where
				the name of the class is).</para>
			<para>For example, to return a class list for students with active enrolments in Woodwork
				WDWK-0010 the query would be:</para>
			<programlisting>
select c.firstname, c.lastname from enrolment as e
join student as s on e.studentid = s.id
join contact as c on s.contactid = c.id
join courseclass as cc on e.courseclass_id = cc.id
join course on cc.courseid = course.id
where e.status = 3 and course.code like 'WDWK' and cc.code like '0001'
			</programlisting>
			<para>Adding additional fields to the select list would increase the detail returned, like the
				student's address, or their class start date. Adding additional options to the where
				statement would change what parameters you were searching for.</para>
			<para>You can right click on the list returned to data to export it into excel or another
				format for your own requirements.</para>
