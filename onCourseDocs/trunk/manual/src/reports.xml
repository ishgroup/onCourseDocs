		<title>Using reports</title>
		<para>onCourse comes prepackaged with a large range of reports. You can use them as is, or
			copy and modify any of them to suit your needs. You can also create brand new reports
			from scratch.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Printing Reports in onCourse</title>
			<para>The first thing to be aware of when attempting to print a report is that you must
				be in the right onCourse list view to print a report. For example, Class roll is a
				report available from the class list. You can not print this report from inside the
				class record, or from the general window. You must open the class window
				first.</para>
			<para>From each list window, you can either select File > Print or click on the new
				Print icon, to see the list of available reports, </para>

					<para>Print Icon in the contacts list view</para>

			</mediaobject>
			<para>All reports are printed to a PDF file which you can save to your computer, email,
				or print to a printer on your network. Your computer will need to have a PDF reader
				installed to create and view the report. Windows operating systems prior to Windows
				8 need to have this manually installed as one is not included as part of the
				operating system. OSX includes an embedded PDF reader called Preview. </para>
			<para>For exports to excel, XML or other formats, see the chapter <link
					xlink:href="importExport.html">Importing and Exporting.</link>
			</para>
			<para>Before you print a report, you will usually need to run a query on the data first.
				For example, if you wish to print the class rolls for all the classes starting this
				week, you will need to do an advanced query for classes starting from today, to the
				last day of the week. For more information on queries, see the chapter Getting
				Started.</para>
			<para>The print dialogue box provides an alphabetized list of all reports available via
				the given window, simply select the relevant report and a summary description is
				provided of the highlighted report. This description will also clarify as to whether
				the report prints in Portrait or Landscape format.</para>
			<para>In the print dialogue, you will be asked if you want to print selected or
				highlighted records. A record count will be given for each option. Choosing
				'selected' will print the results from the query you have run. Choosing highlighted
				will print the report for the one or more records you have selected in the list. </para>
			<section>
				<title>Managing Print Backgrounds </title>
				<para>onCourse printed reports can be set up with a defined background or overlay
					allowing the user to utilise different backgrounds or headers dependent upon the
					particular report. These backgrounds can be set up as a PDF document that is
					then imported into onCourse via the report window. </para>
				<para>Generally, a college will have a standard 'letterhead' style background,
					available in both portrait and landscape modes that can be used as the print
					background to common reports like invoices, enrolment confirmations and class
					rolls.</para>
				<para>In addition, the college may have one or more background reports for their
					Qualification, Statement of Attainment, Transcript and Certificate of Attendance
					reports. These backgrounds will usually contain formal elements such the
					colleges contact details, RTO ID, the business logo, the AQF and/or NRT logos
					and possibly the certificate signatory details &amp; signature. They also may
					contain optional design elements such as borders, background images or
					watermarks.</para>
				<para>By using the background function for activities such as certificate printing
					design, with only the text based contents coming from the onCourse report, a
					college can modify their backgrounds at any time,without access to sophisticated
					software or report writing skills.</para>
				<para>As a general rule you will have about 30mm at the top of the first reports
					page to add you logo and any text around it. If you want the exact dimensions
					you can go to the Reports list view, highlight the report you want to find these
					dimensions for, then click on the cog wheel and choose the option 'Save report
					file on disk'. Then to open the file you would have to download a tool called
					JasperSoft Studio, more information about this can be found in the <link
						xlink:href="reports-custom.html">Creating custom reports</link> chapter of
					the user manual.</para>
				<section>
					<title>Setting Up the Report Print Backgrounds</title>
					<para>The following instructions outline how you can set up your report print
						backgrounds which will be overlaid with the report content:</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>Create a new Microsoft Word or iWork Pages document and ensure
								that the page set up is set to Portrait.</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Open up the Header for the new document and place the required
								logo and contact details you wish the report to display.</para>
							<tip>
								<para>Ensure that the elements that you place within the header do
									not exceed the dimensions of the report header space. </para>
							</tip>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Once you have completed the set up of the page header, save the
								document as a PDF so that it is ready to be imported into onCourse
								as a background. Make sure that you clearly label within the name of
								the PDF whether the document is Portrait or Landscape format.
							</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Reset the original Word or Pages document to display in Landscape
								format, then realign the elements within Header to ensure it fits
								within the dimensions of the Header.</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Repeat step 3 making sure that you clearly label within the name
								of the PDF whether the document is Portrait or Landscape
								format</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Selecting a Background when Running the Report</title>
					<para>Once you have created the print backgrounds for your reports, you can now
						import those PDF backgrounds into onCourse and attach them to the specific
						report. You only need to import each report background once. </para>
					<para>Selecting the relevant background is managed via the print dialogue box of
						onCourse. The following instructions outline how you can apply the relevant
						backgrounds to your reports:</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>The first option within the drop down menu of available
								backgrounds is 'no background'. If you select this option it simply
								means that the header of the report will be blank (no logos or text
								will appear).</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>The drop down menu will also display any other backgrounds that
								you have previously imported into onCourse. As per the following
								example, this is where the naming convention of the backgrounds
								becomes very important, particularly with respect to whether the
								background is in Portrait or Landscape format. If you select a
								Landscape template for a report which is printed in Portrait format,
								the report will not work. </para>
							<mediaobject>
								<imageobject>
									<imagedata scalefit="1" width="80%" contentdepth="80%"
										fileref="images/PrintBackgroundOptions.png"/>
								</imageobject>
								<caption>
									<para>Select the relevant print background from the drop down
										menu</para>
								</caption>
							</mediaobject>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>If you wish to import a new background PDF document, select
								'import from disk' from the drop down menu, this will bring up a
								dialogue box to allow you to select the background you wish to use
								for this report. Note also that the newly imported print background
								will be auto selected as the background for the Report you are
								currently running by default. </para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Once you have either selected an existing background or imported a
								new one from disk, you simply run the report, which will generate a
								PDF output of the report with the specified background.</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>
					<tip>
						<para>The chosen report will display the last background used as the default
							when printing that report. But you can simply select an alternate
							background from the drop down menu or import a new background if you so
							chose. </para>
					</tip>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Managing Print Backgrounds</title>
					<para>Once you have uploaded the PDF documents that become the print backgrounds
						for your reports, you can then manage these backgrounds via the Report
						window of onCourse.</para>
					<para>To access these backgrounds go to <guimenuitem> File - Preferences -
							Reports</guimenuitem> then select 'Manage print backgrounds' via the
						cogwheel icon of the Report window.</para>

						is no longer being utilised. </para>

					</mediaobject>
					<tip>
						<para>You can only import new backgrounds via the Print dialogue box when
							printing a given report. This process cannot be done via the Report
							window of onCourse.</para>
					</tip>
				</section>
				<section>
					<title>Managing Backgrounds for Custom Reports</title>
					<para>The ability to apply a print background to your Custom Reports provides
						users with a much greater level of flexibility particularly in reference to
						generating Certificates. </para>
					<para>One example of this is that if your College has more than one entity such
						as a separate Business Training College, by setting up different print
						backgrounds for each of your entities, including logos and branding, you can
						manage the generation of certificates for both entities with ease. Whereas
						previously the images were embedded within the Custom Report itself, these
						images are now part of the print background. </para>
					<para>You can also apply new backgrounds to your Custom Reports without the need
						to contact ish to request changes to your Custom Report, you can simply
						manage this by updating the print background that is used for the relevant
						custom report.</para>
