		<title>Using reports</title>
		<para>onCourse comes prepackaged with a large range of reports. You can use them as is, or copy
			and modify any of them to suit your needs. You can also create brand new reports from
			scratch.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Printing Reports in onCourse</title>
			<para>The first thing to be aware of when attempting to print a report is that you must
				be in the right onCourse list view to print a report. For example, Class roll is a
				report available from the class list. You can not print this report from inside the
				class record, or from the general window. You must open the class window
				first.</para>
			<para>From each list window, you can either select File > Print, or click on the Share icon > PDF
				to see the list of available reports, </para>

					<para>Share icon in the Sites list view</para>

			</mediaobject>
			<para>All reports are printed to a PDF file which you can save to your computer, email, or print
				to a printer on your network. Your computer will need to have a PDF reader installed
				to create and view the report. </para>
			<para>For exports to excel, XML or other formats, see the chapter <link
					xlink:href="importExport.html">Importing and Exporting.</link>
			</para>
			<para>Before you print a report, you will usually need to collate your data by running a query on
				it first. For example, if you wish to print the class rolls for all the classes
				starting this week, you will need to do an advanced query for classes starting from
				today, to the last day of the week. For more information on queries, see the chapter
				Getting Started.</para>
			<para>The print dialogue box provides an alphabetized list of all reports available via
				the given window, simply select the relevant report and a summary description is
				provided of the highlighted report. This description will also clarify as to whether
				the report prints in Portrait or Landscape format.</para>
			<para>In the print dialogue, you will be asked if you want to print selected or all records. A
				record count will be given for each option. Choosing 'selected' will print the
				results you have highlighted manually, while choosing 'all' will print the report
				for the one or more records you have selected in the list. </para>
			<section>
				<title>Managing Print Backgrounds </title>
				<para>onCourse printed reports can be set up with a defined background or overlay allowing the
                    user to utilise different backgrounds or headers dependent upon the particular
                    report. These backgrounds must be created as a PDF document that is then
                    imported into onCourse via the Automation window. </para>
				<para>Generally, a college will have a standard 'letterhead' style background,
					available in both portrait and landscape modes that can be used as the print
					background to common reports like invoices, enrolment confirmations and class
					rolls.</para>
				<para>In addition, the college may have one or more background reports for their
					Qualification, Statement of Attainment, Transcript and Certificate of Attendance
					reports. These backgrounds will usually contain formal elements such the
					colleges contact details, RTO ID, the business logo, the AQF and/or NRT logos
					and possibly the certificate signatory details &amp; signature. They also may
					contain optional design elements such as borders, background images or
					watermarks.</para>
				<para>By using the background function for activities such as certificate printing
					design, with only the text based contents coming from the onCourse report, a
					college can modify their backgrounds at any time,without access to sophisticated
					software or report writing skills.</para>
				<para>As a general rule you will have about 30mm at the top of the first reports page to add you
                    logo and any text around it. If you want the exact dimensions you can go to the
                    Automation section, scroll to PDF Reports, highlight the report you want to find
                    these dimensions for. If it's a default ish report, you'll need to click the
                    cogwheel, save as a new PDF report and enter a new key. Then you can highlight
                    the new report, click the 'edit' button. If the report is a custom made one, you
                    can simply click the 'edit' button. Then to open the file you would have to
                    download a tool called JasperSoft Studio, more information about this can be
                    found in the <link xlink:href="reports-custom.html">Creating custom
                        reports</link> chapter of the user manual.</para>
				<section>
					<title>Setting Up New Backgrounds</title>
					<para>The following instructions outline how you can set up your report print
						backgrounds which will be overlaid with the report content:</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>Create a new Microsoft Word or Apple Pages document and ensure that the page set up is
                                set to Portrait.</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Open up the Header for the new document and place the required
								logo and contact details you wish the report to display.</para>
							<tip>
								<para>Ensure that the elements that you place within the header do
									not exceed the dimensions of the report header space. </para>
							</tip>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Once you have completed the set up of the page header, save the
								document as a PDF so that it is ready to be imported into onCourse
								as a background. Make sure that you clearly label within the name of
								the PDF whether the document is Portrait or Landscape format.
							</para>
						    <tip><para>You can create a two page background by saving your PDF with a blank second page</para></tip>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Reset the original Word or Pages document to display in Landscape
								format, then realign the elements within Header to ensure it fits
								within the dimensions of the Header.</para>
						</listitem>

							<para>Repeat step 3 making sure that you clearly label within the name
								of the PDF whether the document is Portrait or Landscape
								format</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>

					<title>Adding a New Background to onCourse</title>
					<para>Once you have created the print backgrounds for your reports, you can now import those
                        PDF backgrounds into onCourse and attach them to their relevant reports. You
                        only need to import each report background once. </para>
					<para>Report Backgrounds are managed within the Automation window:</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>In onCourse, from the Dashboard, search for 'Automation' then click it open the window.

					<title>Managing Backgrounds for Custom Reports</title>
					<para>The ability to apply a print background to your Custom Reports provides
						users with a much greater level of flexibility particularly in reference to
						generating Certificates. </para>
					<para>One example of this is that if your College has more than one entity such
						as a separate Business Training College, by setting up different print
						backgrounds for each of your entities, including logos and branding, you can
						manage the generation of certificates for both entities with ease. Whereas
						previously the images were embedded within the Custom Report itself, these
						images are now part of the print background. </para>
					<para>You can also apply new backgrounds to your Custom Reports without the need
						to contact ish to request changes to your Custom Report, you can simply
						manage this by updating the print background that is used for the relevant
						custom report.</para>

        <para>Some of these reports, like Certificates, are available from the Enrolments or
            Certificates window, and can also be generated through cogwheel functions. See

            <para>Use: onCourse includes AQF recommended templates for full Qualification
                Certificates, Statements of Attainment and transcripts. Certificates can only be
                generated from units that are recorded as part of onCourse enrolments. If you wish
                to include Credit Transfer units, you will need to add these outcomes to the
                students record before you create the certificate. For detailed information
                regarding VET Certificates, refer to the RTO Guide Chapter of the User Manual. </para>
            <para>Report Location: From the <guimenu>Certificate</guimenu> window, select the

                the <guimenu>Certificate</guimenu> from the drop down menu of reports. Remember to
                select the appropriate background for this report then run the report.</para>
            <para>Report Notes: The resulting report (Statement of Attainment or Qualification) is
                dependent on how you have set up the Certificate record. If you have more units in
                the Statement than will fit on a single page, the report will automatically break
                into two pages.</para>
