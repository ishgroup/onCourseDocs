			<title>What are outcomes?</title>
			<para>A students outcome is the record of their engagement with a Unit of Competency or
				Module from a training package or accredited course. Outcomes are often reported to
				government through processes such as AVETMISS and must meet certain validation
				rules. Primarily, an outcome records if a student has passed or failed their course.
				The outcomes available for selection are as follows:</para>

						<question>
							<para> Why would I want to change the start and end date of an outcome?
							</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> If a class falls over a collection period (usually a calendar
								year) and some students have been assessed and passed already, they
								can be reported with an end date in the current year. The students
								who have not yet been assessed, and have end dates in the following
								year will be automatically exported with outcomes of 70. You do not
								need to set the outcome to 70, then come back and change it when the
								results are received. </para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> What is the funding source field for? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> In some types of classes, overseas fee paying students may be
								attending, as well as Australian fee-paying students, and Australian
								government funded students. By setting the appropriate funding
								source at the outcome level, you report the correct student contact
								hours to your funding body, without having to move student
								enrolments into different class groups. If you deliver CSWE
								programs, where this often an issue, there is more information
								available here about how to set up your courses and outcomes.
							</para>

					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> I report my statistics to BACE and also need to report my
								non-accredited course outcomes. How do I do this? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> 'outcomes' are also created for general enrolments and VET flagged non-accredited
								courses. On export, they will automatically be set as type
									<emphasis>81 - Non-assessed enrolment - Satisfactorily
									completed</emphasis>. You still need to manually set the
								outcomes for students who do not complete or attend the class as
									<emphasis> 82 - Non-assessed enrolment - Withdrawn or not
									satisfactorily completed</emphasis>
							</para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> What are reportable hours? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> There is some disagreement between different state funding bodies
								on what number should appear in this field. Generally, it is
								understood to be the nominal hours, as defined by NCVER tables. The
								nominal hours set for each module will be the default reportable
								hours reported in your NAT00120 file. Non-accredited courses report
								the classroom hours in this field. If you prefer to report the
								classroom hours in this field, you can set this in the class VET
								tab, however you will need to do this BEFORE enrolling students,
								otherwise you will need to change the hours outcome by outcome. In
								some cases, you may need to modify the nominal hours reported for
								students being funded under particular programs, and you should do
								this in their outcome record. </para>
						</answer>

						<question>
							<para> A student who enrolled in one of our VET classes has completed
								and passed the assessment without attending the class. How do I

								record? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> Find an enrolment record for the student and open the outcomes tab. Here you can add
								additional outcomes as needed. Units completed at another training
								organisation should be marked as <emphasis> 60 - Credit
									transfer</emphasis> and their nominal hours are not counted
								towards your colleges annual delivery. On the 'Notes' tab of the
								students record, you can also add attachments, and it would be
								appropriate to scan and attach copies of their original

					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para>A student has changed their mind about an elective choice, or
								wishes to do an additional unit. How do I add or change their
								record?</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>Find the enrolment record for the student and open the outcomes
								tab. Here you can change, delete or add additional outcomes as
								needed. To change an outcome from one unit to another, double click
								on the outcome record and change the module code. Modules for which
								you have already issued certificates for can not be edited and
								you'll see that they are greyed out. </para>
							<para>Using the plus or delete icon in the top right hand corner allows

			<title>Setting up Certificate in Spoken and Written English (CSWE) courses</title>
			<para> Some colleges who deliver CSWE courses run open English language programs at different
				levels, aligned to the levels available in the CSWE program. Students enrol in
				course that is of an appropriate level and when a class group is formed, the tutor
				then assess the students and selects appropriate units from the CSWE curriculum for
				them to work towards. Some students in a class group may be working towards a single
				unit, while others may be working towards multiple units. Some students may be fee
				paying, some may be funded under various government programs. Some students may
				enrol in a class two or three times before attempting assessment against a CSWE unit
				and some students may not wish to be assessed at all. All of these circumstances
				combined can make headaches for the English classes coordinator who both wants to
				make sure the students and tutors needs are met, as well as reporting accurate
				statistics for funding purposes. Don't worry - onCourse has you covered! </para>

				<para>If you college chooses different modules for each class, when you create a

			<para>By generating the certificate record, using one of the three methods described below, you
				will have created the data required to meet the AQTF 2010 Condition 6 -
				Certification &amp; issuing of Qualifications &amp; Statements of Attainment. The
				certificate record you create is available in the certificate table in onCourse.
				Once created, the certificate record can be edited and amended or even deleted prior
				to printing, but after the record is printed it becomes locked in the database to
				ensure an accurate record of your issued certificates are retained.</para>
			<para>After printing a certificate, if you determine the certificate was printed in
				error, you can chose to revoke the certificate using the cogwheel option. This
				maintains the certificate reference in the database, with a note as to why you have
				revoked it. A revoked certificate can not be printed, but other valid certificates
				can be reprinted at any time. The last date you printed the certificate is
				automatically recorded in the certificate record.</para>
			<para>Certificate records in onCourse can either be full Qualifications, Statements of
				Attainment working towards a Qualification, Statements of Attainment with no
				qualification reference, or a Statement of Attainment for a skill set.</para>
			<para>When a certificate record is created, there is a radio button option to select if
				the Certificate is a Qualification or Statement of Attainment. Based on this
				information, plus the data or lack of data in the Qualification name/national code
				fields and the Public (printed) notes field, onCourse automatically selects the
				correct layout of the certificate template to print.</para>
			<para>It is worth noting, that as with the course set up process, onCourse does not
				contain any reference data to determine if a full Qualification is valid or not. It
				is up to you as the certifying RTO to ensure when you create and issue a certificate
				record you have deemed a qualification, the student has achieved sufficient outcomes
				and attach those outcomes to the certificate record.</para>
			<para>You can attach any outcome from a students transcript to the certificate record,
				but if you attach an outcome where the status has not yet been set e.g. student has
				not been set as Competent or not yet competent, you will not be able to print the
				certificate records until you have updated the outcome status.</para>
			<para>You can also choose to attach unsuccessful outcomes to the certificate record, for
				example, outcomes where the student has withdrawn or been deemed not yet competent.
				These outcomes will print on the accompanying transcript that is generated when you
				print a certificate, but will not print on the Statement of Attainment certificate
				face. Only successful outcomes will print on the certificate face. </para>
			<para>Every certificate record created is issued a unique certificate number, which is
				printed on the certificate face. The same number series is used for Qualifications
				and Statements of Attainment. The records will begin at 1 and automatically
				increment each time a certificate is created. </para>
			<para>If you are required to generate a submit AVETMISS data, any certificate record you
				create that is marked as being for a full Qualification will create a corresponding
				record in the NAT00130 file.</para>
			<para>You can also go to File > Import/Export > Export Certificates to create a CSV file
				of your certificate register.</para>

			<title>Customising the layout of your VET Certificate template</title>
			<para>Within the onCourse user interface, you can make some customisations of your

				outside of onCourse.</para>
			<para>By default, all onCourse certificate templates will print a signature line with
				the word 'Principal' underneath. If you would like to replace the word Principal
				with the title and/or name of your certificate signatory you need to go to File >

		<title>Courses by Cluster</title>
		<para>How to set up qualifications that are delivered by internal clusters where units of
			competency overlap</para>
		<para> Clusters, in this case, refers to an internal grouping of units of competency that a
			college delivers to break up a qualification into teaching-focused groups of units.
			Sometimes one unit from a qualification may be delivered across multiple clusters, and a
			student must successfully complete the assessments in each cluster to acheive competency
			in the unit. For example the Qualification Certificate IV in Training and Assessment has
			12 units in total, but the four Environment units are assessed in each cluster. The
			course is delivered in three clusters and each cluster has a fee that applies to it. </para>
		<section>
			<title>Creating the Qualification</title>
			<para>Create a new course and attach all the units that you deliver as part of the
				qualification. This is the formal enrolment where you will record the student's
				completion of outcomes once assessment has been sufficiently completed across your
				various clusters.</para>
			<para>This is the course that you will advertise on your website, so make sure you
				include the full course description and information about how you deliver the
				program.</para>
			<para>Next, create a class for this course, entering the dates, student fees and venue
				information. Details on how to create a class is available here. Web enable this
				class so students can enrol. </para>
			<para>You may choose to set up this class as an 'application fee enrolment' and advise
				the students of the full fee within this class description. Do this by setting the
				class fee as the amount you wish them to pay to apply, and ensure your information
				explains what the approval process involves. You will need to contact students who
				apply and inform them of their success or otherwise, and organise payment of the
				full course fees. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Creating the clusters</title>
			<para>The cluster courses that you create are for your scheduling and management
				purposes only. They will not be advertised online, as you will enrol students in
				these classes as appropriate.</para>
			<para>The clusters that you create are not VET courses - do not attach the qualification or units
				of competency to these records. You can put details of the units and content covered
				in the description if you wish.</para>
			<para>Set up each course and class with the assigned rooms, tutors and sessions</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Enrolments and Payment</title>
			<para>As onCourse will invoice students class fees, you can allow students to make full
				payments or part payments at the time of enrolment.</para>
			<para>For example, you could set the full fee on the first class and track students as
				they make payments towards this total amount. Alternatively, you could set up
				multiple classes with fees attached, so students are only invoiced for a portion of
				the course fee each time they are enrolled in a new cluster.</para>
			<para>In the example below, the full qualification has an application fee of $100, paid
				online. Once the student's enrolment has been accepted, they are invoiced $900 for
				the first cluster, and $500 for each of the subsequent clusters, until a total of
				$2000 has been paid.</para>

		<para>The custom class function available through Quick Enrol allows users to create these
