		<title>Chapter Overview</title>
		<para>This chapter looks at how a RTO can prepare their courses and classes in onCourse to
			ensure they're set up properly and can correctly report their data for funding. Included
			in this chapter is what to do before taking enrolments, how to set up funding
			sources/contracts, and how to set up sites, courses and classes.</para>

		<title>Before Taking Enrolments</title>
		<para>If you're required to report AVETMISS or funded training there are a few steps you'll
			need to take to ensure that reporting time goes as smoothly as possible. Do these things
			before you accept your first enrolment into any VET classes.</para>
		<section xml:id="rto-enrolments-general">
			<title>Set up General Preferences</title>
			<para>Set up your AVETMISS details within the General Preferences window. To access
				this, in the navigation menu click File > Preferences > General, then find the
				AVETMISS tab in the left-hand column on the window. 'Show RTO related screens and
				menus' should be enabled. Then fill out the rest of the page and be especially
				certain that both your Training organisation name and RTO Identifier field match the
				details recorded on training.gov.au.</para>

			<tip>
				<para>In this section when we talk about Qualifications we really mean
					"Qualifications, Accredited Courses or Skillsets". When we say "Unit of
					Competency" we also include "Modules". Although the words are different between
					state and commonwealth accreditation regimes, the processes in onCourse are
					exactly the same.</para>
			</tip>
			<para>Before going any further, you should read the <link
					xlink:href="courses.xml#courses">Courses chapter</link> to understand the basics
				of what a course is in onCourse, and how to go about creating one.</para>
			<para>Once you have a course created, in the VET tab of the new course record you can
				select the Qualification and the Units from the built in NTIS data for your chosen
				course. If your course is VET, but not from a training package or accredited course,
				you can also flag it VET here and allocate its Field of Education ID. This is
				something you may need to do as part of your government funding requirements for non
				accredited courses.</para>
			<tip>
				<para>Do you deliver state accredited courses? You will find the course listed in
					onCourse but not the modules that make up the course. This is because they are
					not publicly available on training.gov.au. You can add your own by hitting the +
					button on either the Qualifications or Units of Competency windows.</para>
			</tip>
			<para>onCourse does not contain the qualification packaging rules, so it is up to you as
				the RTO to ensure that you are compliant with your own scope of registration and the
				requirements of the training packages you are authorised to deliver. You should
				refer to these requirements when creating your courses and only select those units
				which are allowed to contribute towards that particular qualification.</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<title>There are a few different ways you can structure VET Courses within
					onCourse:</title>
				<listitem>
					<para> A full Qualification where you know all the units the students will
						complete in advance i.e. all students will complete the same core and
						elective units. Students will graduate with a complete Qualification.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>A full Qualification where all students will undertake the core units, but
						may all select different elective units. Students will graduate with a
						complete Qualification.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>A short course which has one or more units of competency embedded within
						it. The units may or may not all contribute to the same Qualification.
						Students will graduate with a Statement of Attainment.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>A short course where you know which qualification a student will be
						working towards in advance, but the students in the class will complete a
						variable number and selection of units. Some may achieve a Statement of
						Attainment, some may be working towards a full Qualification, and some may
						simply receive a non-vet Statement of Attendance.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>A course which is not linked to any national or state accredited training
						packages or accredited courses, but has a vocational learning outcome.
						Depending on your reporting requirements, these courses may also contribute
						towards your annual VET delivery.</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>In onCourse, outcomes (records of undertaking and achieving a unit of competency)
				flow down from the course to the student via an enrolment in a class. If a course
				has 15 units attached to it, the students enrolled in that class will have 15
				outcomes created for them - one for each unit. You can always modify the units for
				the student in their own enrolment, for example if they change to a different
				elective. </para>

				<title>How to "add" a unit of competency to a course</title>
				<para>You cannot actually add a Unit of competency to a course if it already has
					enrolments (see the caution above), you can only cancel the old course and then
					create a new course with the additional unit of competency you want included.
					This is because changing the units of competency changes the very nature of the
					course, but the history of the old course and it's previous students need to be
					retained. </para>
				<para>If needed, you can also add units directly to student enrolments. This will
					not change the course units for new students enrolling, but can be used to
					correct or update the records of existing students.</para>
				<para>If the unit change is substantial, you may want to consider creating a new
					class against the new course, and transferring all the students from the class
					linked to the old course to the class linked to the new course. This will remove
					all the old units from their record (provided outcomes have not yet been set),
					and with their new enrolment, add all the new units to their record.</para>
				<caution>
					<title>Changing units in a course</title>
					<para>Once a course has a class with an enrolment in it you CAN NOT change the
						units of competency assigned to the course. This is because onCourse has
						created an immutable relationship with this data - if you changed it at the
						course level, every student ever enrolled in a class for this course would
						have their outcomes changed. </para>
					<para>However - you can always retire the old course and create a new course to
						use for future enrolment using the 'duplicate course' option in the list
						view cogwheel. The new course can have the same name but will have to have a
						different course code. You may choose to change the code of the old course
						instead, so the new course can use the existing code, which is advantageous
						for your SEO. Make sure to set the status of the old course to 'course
						disabled' and when you are ready, the status of the new course to 'enabled
						and visible online'. </para>
					<para>You may also want to duplicate one of the classes from the old course and
						assign it to the new course to use the same timetables and teaching
						schedules. </para>
				</caution>

						<para>First go to "Course" list view and single click to select the old

					</listitem>

						<para>From the cogwheel, select the option 'duplicate course'. This will
							make another course with the same name and all the same content, with a

					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Courses can have the same name, but every course has to have a unique
							code. Because the course code is what forms your URL on the website, it
							is better for SEO purposes to change the code of the old course to
							something different before you disable it e.g. BCDCERTV could become
							oldBCDCERTV. Then you can change the code of the new version of the
							course from BCDCERTV1 back to BCDCERTV.</para>

							oldBCDCERTV-90.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Using the class cog wheel option, duplicate this class, making any

						<para>Double click on the new class to open it. In the course code field in

						<para>NOTE: You can only change the course a class is linked to before any

				<title>Courses which are complete qualifications or skill sets</title>
				<para>When a course has the flag 'Satisfies complete qualification or skill set'
					checked on the VET tab, this means that if the student successfully completes
					all of the attached units, they will be eligible for a Qualification or Skill
					Set Statement of Attainment. </para>
				<para>Using the automatic 'create Certificates' options from the class or enrolment
					cogwheels will look at the value of this flag and determine what type of
					certification to create.</para>
				<para>This flag, for AVETMISS purposes, also signifies the student's intent to
					complete a qualification. Outcomes linked to a class with this flag checked will
					be reported linked to the parent qualification, where courses where this isn't
					selected will be reported as module only enrolments.</para>
				<para>This value of this checkbox can be changed as needed after the course has been
					created, and even after students have enrolled.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Partial qualifications</title>
				<para>Remember that in onCourse a course is about the product you are selling to
					your students. Sometimes you may break a program of study e.g. full
					qualification into lots of short courses for students to buy, complete and over
					time, to work towards the final outcome of a qualification.</para>
				<para>In onCourse, courses don't have to be linked to a qualification or a unit of
					competency. They can just be a non-accredited course.</para>
				<para>If students are working towards a unit of competency that they will complete
					in another course, you may like to indicate this in the program description that
					you use for marketing purposes. If the student only completes this course, they
					will only be eligible for a non-accredited Certificate of Attendance, not a
					Statement of Attainment.</para>
				<para>You can set up this type of program in onCourse by attaching the Qualification
					that the student will be working towards in the VET tab of the course, but not
					adding any Units of Competency to the course. You do not have to add the
					Qualification at all - this is optional, and would not be appropriate if the
					program of study never led to any formal Qualification outcome.</para>
				<para>When students enrol in this course, they will get a dummy outcome (used for
					reporting purposes in some states) with the name of the course. You can set this
					dummy outcome to pass (81) or fail (82). Using this outcome, you will then know
					when the student enrols in the next course (where the units have been attached)
					that they have successfully completed the part one component.</para>
				<para>When you set up the second part of the course, you will add the qualification
					and the units to the VET tab, so when the student enrols they will get the
					appropriate units of competency added to their record. Then you are able to
					record their final outcome result as per the standard list of VET
					options.</para>
				<para>In the example below, a student is working towards a cluster of units from the
					Certificate I in IT. Only when they have completed the second course,
					Understanding Computer Basics, are they eligible to be assessed against the unit
					outcomes. The first course, Computing Basics, has no units attached, and the
					second course has three units attached. </para>
