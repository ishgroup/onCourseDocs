		<para>When a student enrols in the class, the units of competency attached to the course
			become the outcomes attached to the student's enrolment. The start and end date of class
			become the start and end date of the outcomes, unless you choose to define different
			dates in the training plan. The settings on the class VET tab become the default
			settings for each outcome for that class, but can be changed on an outcome by outcome
			basis. Within the class level outcomes can be changed or set, but can not be deleted and

			<title>Cancelling VET enrolments</title>
			<para>Sometimes when you cancel a VET enrolment, it is because it was created in error and you
				want to delete all the outcomes. At other times, often when the training is funded,
				you want the enrolment cancelled to make another position available in the class,
				but have the outcomes retained for reporting purposes.</para>
			<para>When you cancel an enrolment, by defult the checkbox option retains any outcomes
				that have had a status set, and deletes any outcomes with a status of 'not
				set'.</para>
			<para>If, at this point, no outcomes have had their status set (for example, the student
				was enrolled into the wrong class) then all outcomes will be deleted. However, if
				this was a funded enrolment and you wanted to retain all the outcomes to later mark
				as 'withdrawn' then you can uncheck this option.</para>
			<para>If you are cancelling an enrolment where you have already set all the outcomes,
				e.g. all set to withdrawn already, leaving this option checked will delete
				nothing.</para>
			<para>If you have set outcomes on an enrolment record and want them deleted, and not
				retained, then you will need to either set them back to 'not set' before cancelling
				the enrolment, or you can manually delete them from the enrolment record after
				processing the cancellation.</para>
			<para>If you have created a certificate that includes outcomes from the enrolment, they will
				always be retained on the student's outcome and can not be deleted manually, even if
				the certificate has been revoked.</para>

		<section>
			<title>What are outcomes?</title>
			<para>A students outcome is the record of their engagement with a Unit of Competency or
				Module from a training package or accredited course. Outcomes are often reported to
				government through processes such as AVETMISS and must meet certain validation
				rules. Primarily, an outcome records if a student has passed or failed their course.
				The outcomes available for selection are as follows:</para>
			<simplelist>
				<member> Competency achieved/pass (20)</member>
				<member> Competency not achieved/fail (30)</member>
				<member> Withdrawn (40)</member>

						<question>
							<para> Why would I want to change the start and end date of an outcome?
							</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> If a class falls over a collection period (usually a calendar
								year) and some students have been assessed and passed already, they
								can be reported with an end date in the current year. The students
								who have not yet been assessed, and have end dates in the following
								year will be automatically exported with outcomes of 70. You do not
								need to set the outcome to 70, then come back and change it when the
								results are received. </para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> What is the funding source field for? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> In some types of classes, overseas fee paying students may be
								attending, as well as Australian fee-paying students, and Australian
								government funded students. By setting the appropriate funding
								source at the outcome level, you report the correct student contact
								hours to your funding body, without having to move student
								enrolments into different class groups. If you deliver CSWE
								programs, where this often an issue, there is more information
								available here about how to set up your courses and outcomes.
							</para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> I report my statistics to ACE and also need to report my non-accredited course
								outcomes. How do I do this? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> 'outcomes' are also created for general enrolments and VET flagged non-accredited
								courses. On export, they will automatically be set as type
									<emphasis>81 - Non-assessed enrolment - Satisfactorily
									completed</emphasis>. You still need to manually set the
								outcomes for students who do not complete or attend the class as
									<emphasis> 82 - Non-assessed enrolment - Withdrawn or not
									satisfactorily completed</emphasis>
							</para>
						</answer>
					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para> What are reportable hours? </para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para> There is some disagreement between different state funding bodies
								on what number should appear in this field. Generally, it is
								understood to be the nominal hours, as defined by NCVER tables. The
								nominal hours set for each module will be the default reportable
								hours reported in your NAT00120 file. Non-accredited courses report
								the classroom hours in this field. If you prefer to report the
								classroom hours in this field, you can set this in the class VET
								tab, however you will need to do this BEFORE enrolling students,
								otherwise you will need to change the hours outcome by outcome. In
								some cases, you may need to modify the nominal hours reported for
								students being funded under particular programs, and you should do
								this in their outcome record. </para>
						</answer>

						<question>
							<para> A student who enrolled in one of our VET classes has completed
								and passed the assessment without attending the class. How do I

						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>Open the student record and go to the education tab.  In the section called 'prior
								learning' you can add additional outcomes as needed. Units completed
								at another training organisation should be marked as <emphasis> 60 -
									Credit transfer</emphasis> and their nominal hours are not
								counted towards your colleges annual delivery. On the 'documents'
								tab of the prior learning record, you can also add attachments, and
								it would be appropriate to scan and attach copies of their original

					</qandaentry>
					<qandaentry>
						<question>
							<para>A student has changed their mind about an elective choice, or
								wishes to do an additional unit. How do I add or change their
								record?</para>
						</question>
						<answer>
							<para>Find the enrolment record for the student and open the outcomes
								tab. Here you can change, delete or add additional outcomes as
								needed. To change an outcome from one unit to another, double click
								on the outcome record and change the module code. Modules for which
								you have already issued certificates for can not be edited and
								you'll see that they are greyed out. </para>
							<para>Using the plus or delete icon in the top right hand corner allows
								you to add or remove modules to the student's record. You can add as

			<section>
				<title>Manually adding prior learning records</title>
				<para>The education tab of a student record is comprised of four sections - enrolments, prior

					non-vet and linked to no formal study units.</para>
				<para>To add prior learning to a student record, click on the + option to the right
					of the prior learning panel.</para>
				<para>Prior learning must have a title - this can be descriptive of the course or
					training conducted elsewhere. Optionally, the prior learning record can be
					linked to a Qualifcation or Skills Set on the general tab, contain reference to
					an external system reference number e.g. the course code or enrolment code from
					the previous system and optional descriptive notes.</para>
				<para>On the second tab, outcomes, you can manually add one or more units of
					competency or accredited modules to the prior learning record. It is important
					you add start and end dates to the units of competency, and a valid outcome
					status here if you want to report them for AVETMISS or use the unit to create a
					certificate. If you are adding units completed at another RTO, you should record
					the outcome status as 'Credit Transfer'.</para>
				<para>If you scan any documents, such as a copy of their Certificate, you can add
					them to the prior learning record also. You will just need to make sure you save
					the prior learning record first, before adding documents.</para>

			<para> Some colleges who deliver CSWE courses run open English language programs at different

				then assess the students and selects appropriate units from the CSWE curriculum for

				unit, while others may be working towards multiple units. Some students may be fee
				paying, some may be funded under various government programs. Some students may
				enrol in a class two or three times before attempting assessment against a CSWE unit
				and some students may not wish to be assessed at all. All of these circumstances

		<title>Courses by Cluster</title>
		<para>How to set up qualifications that are delivered by internal clusters where units of
			competency overlap</para>
		<para> Clusters, in this case, refers to an internal grouping of units of competency that a
			college delivers to break up a qualification into teaching-focused groups of units.
			Sometimes one unit from a qualification may be delivered across multiple clusters, and a
			student must successfully complete the assessments in each cluster to achieve competency
			in the unit. For example the Qualification Certificate IV in Training and Assessment has
			12 units in total, but the four Environment units are assessed in each cluster. The
			course is delivered in three clusters and each cluster has a fee that applies to it. </para>
		<section>
			<title>Creating the Qualification</title>
			<para>Create a new course and attach all the units that you deliver as part of the
				qualification. This is the formal enrolment where you will record the student's
				completion of outcomes once assessment has been sufficiently completed across your
				various clusters.</para>
			<para>This is the course that you will advertise on your website, so make sure you
				include the full course description and information about how you deliver the
				program.</para>
			<para>Next, create a class for this course, entering the dates, student fees and venue
				information. Details on how to create a class is available here. Web enable this
				class so students can enrol. </para>
			<para>You may choose to set up this class as an 'application fee enrolment' and advise
				the students of the full fee within this class description. Do this by setting the
				class fee as the amount you wish them to pay to apply, and ensure your information
				explains what the approval process involves. You will need to contact students who
				apply and inform them of their success or otherwise, and organise payment of the
				full course fees. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Creating the clusters</title>
			<para>The cluster courses that you create are for your scheduling and management
				purposes only. They will not be advertised online, as you will enrol students in
				these classes as appropriate.</para>
			<para>The clusters that you create are not VET courses - do not attach the qualification or units
				of competency to these records. You can put details of the units and content covered
				in the description if you wish.</para>
			<para>Set up each course and class with the assigned rooms, tutors and sessions</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Enrolments and Payment</title>
			<para>As onCourse will invoice students class fees, you can allow students to make full
				payments or part payments at the time of enrolment.</para>
			<para>For example, you could set the full fee on the first class and track students as
				they make payments towards this total amount. Alternatively, you could set up
				multiple classes with fees attached, so students are only invoiced for a portion of
				the course fee each time they are enrolled in a new cluster.</para>
			<para>In the example below, the full qualification has an application fee of $100, paid
				online. Once the student's enrolment has been accepted, they are invoiced $900 for
				the first cluster, and $500 for each of the subsequent clusters, until a total of
				$2000 has been paid.</para>

				<title>Enabling the automatic VET Certificate creation script</title>
				<para>Like most included scripts, the 'automatic creation of VET Certificates' script is

					it in the File > Preferences> Scripts menu.</para>
				<para>The script checks at 4am every day check for outcomes which have been modified in the
					previous 24 hrs. If any outcomes attached to the enrolment are not yet marked,
					the enrolment is skipped for certificate creation. When all outcomes have a
					status, then the certificate creation process is triggered. This means if
					outcomes are marked over time, the certificate will not be created until the
					last outcome of the enrolment is marked.</para>
				<para>It is important to note here that an outcome with an intermidate status like a
					70 or 90 will trigger the certificate creation process. There are almost no

				<para>For students with at least one successful outcome, create the certificate

			<title>Manually creating certificates in bulk</title>
		<para>If you wish to create certificate records for the whole class group, we recommend creating
			the certificate records from the class cog wheel option. If at the course level, you
			checked the option 'Satisfies complete qualification or skill set' on the VET tab,
			enrolled students will be automatically generated either the qualification or skill set
			certificate for which the course is for. If you have not selected this option,
			Statements of Attainment will be generated. This option only selects outcomes from the
			student's record that have been created due to their enrolment in this particular
			class.</para>
		<para>Additional validation rules apply to this creation process to ensure that only student's who
					have achieved the outcome of the course are issued with the correct
					certification. For example, where a course is marked 'Satisfies complete
					qualification or skill set' on the VET tab, and the student has one or more unit
					with a non-successful outcome, a Statement of Attainment will be generated
					instead of a Qualification or skill set certificate. Where no outcomes have been
					marked as successful, no Statement of Attainment will be created.</para>
		<para>If you wish to create a certificate based on a single, or group of student's
			enrolments, then you can do the same thing from the enrolment window, by highlighting an

				Attainment working towards a Qualification, Statements of Attainment with no
				qualification reference, or a Statement of Attainment for a skill set.</para>
				<para>If you have created the certificate from the course or enrolment cogwheel process,
					onCourse will select the most appropriate certificate type based on the course
					settings and the student's outcomes. For example, if a student enrolled in a
					complete qualification has one or more outcomes not set, a Statement of
					Attainment, rather than a Qualification will be created for them. You may need
					to add the missing outcome status and then change the certificate type to
					'qualification or skill set' prior to printing.</para>
				<para>You should confirm the certificate record that was created automatically is of the correct
					type prior to printing as this can not be changed afterwards.</para>
			<para>It is worth noting, that as with the course set up process, onCourse does not contain any
					reference data to determine if a full Qualification is valid or not. It is up to
					you as the certifying RTO to ensure when you create and issue a certificate
					record you have deemed a qualification, the student has achieved sufficient
					outcomes those outcomes are attached to the certificate record.</para>
			<para>You can also choose to attach unsuccessful outcomes to the certificate record, for
				example, outcomes where the student has withdrawn or been deemed not yet competent.
				These outcomes will print on the accompanying transcript that is generated when you
				print a certificate, but will not print on the Statement of Attainment certificate
				face. Only successful outcomes will print on the certificate face. </para>
				<para>If you wish to alter the Awarded on date from the default date the record was
					created, or the Issued on date from the default date the certificate was
					printed, you should do this prior to printing. These fields can be changed after
					printing if you notice the dates are incorrect, and the certificate
					reprinted.</para>
				<para>Add any public notes that you wish to display on the certificate face, such as
					information about the funded program that this certificate was delivered under,
					or the language the training was delivered in if not English, need to be
					manually added during the pre-printing verification process. There is no
					automatic population of this data from any where in onCourse. You can add
					information to this field, and the private notes field, after printing if you
					require, and reprint the certificate.</para>

				<title>Certificate Backgrounds</title>
				<para>The standard Qualification and Statement of Attainment reports include a
					second report, the transcript, as the second page.</para>
				<para>If you already have a certificate background you have had professionally
					designed, which you order from the printers, you can choose to embed this
					background in the report. You should request a A4 PDF of your backgrounds
					from your designers first.</para>
				<para>If you do not have a professionally designed background, you can easily
					create your own using a simple word processing tool. Keep in mind the <link
						xlink:href="http://www.asqa.gov.au/qualifications/issuing-qualifications.html"
						> ASQA guidelines for issuing certificates</link> and the appropriate
					use of the formal logos, when designing your backgrounds.</para>
				<para>You will also need a second page PDF background for the transcript
					report.</para>
				<para>If you create and upload a two page PDF, comprised of your Certificate
					design followed by your letterhead or transcript design, for example, these
					pages will be used correctly when printing the combined report from
					onCourse.</para>
				<para>When creating a background for a Qualification or Statement of Attainment
					report, onCourse will apply the first page of your PDF background to the
					first page of your report (the Certificate page), then apply the second page
					of your PDF background to each subsequent page of the Certificate report
					(the Transcript pages). </para>
				<para>If you are printing Certificates in bulk, onCourse will recognise when the

				<para>You can update the signatory name for your Certificate reports via the

					click on the AVETMISS tab, the 'Full certificate signatory name' field you need
					to edit is under 'Optional' on this tab. Whatever content you add to this field,
					will appear automatically within your Certificate Reports, unless your custom
					report has this information hard coded into it.</para>
				<para>If you require a different layout for the signatory fields i.e. two names, name and title
						on separate lines or embedded digital signature, we recommend you put all
						this data in the background and remove the signatory details from the
