        <para>onCourse has powerful tools for searching across every piece of data you have
            collected. You can search in lists, perform advanced searches on any attribute of the
            data and use these searches to write scripts and reports. In this chapter we'll start
            from the simplest tools and then show you more advanced possibilities.</para>

        <para>Typing into the Search bar will retrieve all records that match your input across
            certain fields. For example, in the Contact list, the text you enter will be found in
            first name, last name and email address fields.  <mediaobject>

        <title>Find related records</title>
        <para>Find related records is one of the most powerful tools inside onCourse, let you
            quickly jump from window to window, finding records related to groups of other
            records. This function is located next to the advanced search in each list view in
            onCourse.</para>
        <para>For example, to locate all the employers of all the students aged 18 to 25 in the
            last three months of VET programs to send the Employer Satisfaction Survey to you
            can start by searching for all classes with a particular tag or use the advanced
            search on VET course flag. Once you have those classes, you can highlight those
            delivered in the last three months, and select from the find related icon 'Enrolled
            students'. </para>

        </mediaobject>
        <para>Once the student list has opened, you can search that list of results for students aged 18
            to 25. The list view that has opened is in a special mode called 'custom selection'
            which you can see in the window header bar. This means other searches or filters you
            run on this window are only inside the special set of results you have created as a
            list.</para>
        <para>With the reduced list of students, you can use the find related icon to select
            contacts related as Employer. From this new window, you can use the cog wheel to
            send a message to the student's employers.</para>

        <title>Advanced search query language</title>
        <para>You can construct more powerful Advanced Search queries using the onCourse query
            language. You can toggle between Basic and Advanced Search by clicking the magnifying
            glass icon on the left of the search panel. When you are in advanced mode, a plus symbol
            appears next to the icon.<mediaobject>

        </para>
        <para>A simple query consists of a field, followed by an operator, followed by a
            value:</para>
        <programlisting> 
                title starts with "Apply"             
            </programlisting>
        <para>In the above example, the field is 'title', the operator is 'starts with', and the
            value is 'Apply'. In the Unit of Competency list this will show you records beginning
            with 'Apply'. Two or more queries can be linked together with conditional
            operators.</para>
        <programlisting> 
                title starts with 'Apply' and nationalCode starts with "B"                  
            </programlisting>
        <para>In this example, 'and' is the conditional operator that combines the two separate
            queries. Only records that satisfy both queries are returned.</para>

            example, if you wanted to contact all students who are enrolled in a class starting
