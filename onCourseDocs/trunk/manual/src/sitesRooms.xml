				<title>Virtual Sites</title>
				<para>onCourse allows a College to flag a given Site as a <guilabel>Virtual

				</para>
				<para>When you create a new Site within onCourse and flag it as a <guilabel>Virtual
						Site</guilabel>, onCourse will automatically assign a <guilabel>Virtual
						Room</guilabel> to that site. The reason for this is that Class enrolments
					must be assigned to a Room, they cannot be assigned to just a Site. Whilst this
					virtual room record is hidden within the user interface, it has been created
					automatically when the Site is flagged as being a <guilabel>Virtual
						Site</guilabel>. </para>
				<para>You can also convert an existing Site to a <guilabel>Virtual Site</guilabel>
					by ticking this box within the General tab of the Site Record. Please note that
					if the existing Site which you wish to convert to a Virtual Site has more than 1
					Room allocated against it, it cannot be converted to a Virtual Site. </para>

		<title>Creating Sites and Rooms</title>
		<para>The next step in setting up your onCourse program is entering sites and rooms. You can
			give each room a name, specific directions on how to get there, and describe the
			facilities that are available. It also allows you to make it possible for students to
			view detailed maps and instructions from your website about where their class will be
			held, saving your staff time with phone calls giving directions and saving students
			frustration when they can't accurately locate the venue.</para>
		<para>Creating sites and rooms is a valuable part of your training resource management. Every time
			you book a session in a room, the Classes timetable is updated and the room becomes
			scheduled. This means that if you try to book another session in this room at the same
			time, you will be notified that it is already booked within the Class > Timetable tab.
			It's important to note that onCourse will not prevent you from double booking a
			room.</para>
		<para>If you have a room or site that you hire on a casual basis you can also set the
			availability for it. For example, you may hire a public hall on Wednesday evenings. When
			you set up this room, you can specify it is only available for you to book between 5pm
			and 9pm. Course coordinators scheduling classes will an error message if they try to
			book a class in this room on another night, or to start before 5pm. </para>
		<tip>
			<para>It is a good idea to enter the sites and rooms first so later when you add the
				courses you can easily assign them to a location.</para>
