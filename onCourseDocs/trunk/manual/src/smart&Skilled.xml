		<subtitle>How to get your AVETMISS data out of onCourse to submit to the government funding
			body of your choice</subtitle>
		<para>There are three ways to export your data:</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Export all the total activity data for your college between a defined date
					range, using the file > import/export > export AVETMISS 7 or 8 option</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Export the data related to a class or group of classes, using the

			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Export the data related to an enrolment or group of enrolments, using the
					cogwheel</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>The total activity date based export will export every outcome in your database
			(including non-VET outcomes unless you choose to exclude them) that have activity during
			the period you have selected. This type of export is useful for customers who need to
			report their entire business activity to a monitoring or funding agency. Choosing this
			type of export will automatically export an outcome of 70 for all outcomes which have
			end dates outside the reporting year you define. </para>
		<para>You never need to set an outcome of 70 in onCourse. </para>
		<para>In the AVETMISS runner, you also have an option, ticked by default, to export '90 not
			yet available' for all VET outcomes which are not set. This is almost always the correct
			answer for outcomes being reported within a calendar year, but not still in progress.
			You can also change this value to 81 as needed.</para>
		<para>You never need to set an outcome of 90 or 81 in onCourse. Choosing this option won't
			change the value stored in onCourse, only export the value you need in the AVETMISS
			files. The onCourse outcome status value will remain 'not set'.</para>
		<para>All non-VET outcomes will also be exported as 81, unless you have manually defined
			them within onCourse as 82..</para>

			<title>Validation Rules and State Variations in AVETMISS Reporting</title>
			<section>
				<title>NSW Smart and Skilled (for 2015 onwards data)</title>
				<para>This export option is for reporting Smart &amp; Skilled funded training in NSW
					and meets the requirements of the <link
						xlink:href="https://www.ish.com.au/sites/ish.com.au/files/NOV2015_e-reporting_tech_specs.pdf"
						>Smart and Skilled eReporting Technical Specifications and Business
						Validations Version 1.3 November 2015 specifications.</link></para>
				<para>The 'Outcome identifier - Training Organisation' field has been added to the
					Enrolment general tab to record the possible Training not completed (TNC) or
					Training Deferred (D) value for the enrolment.</para>
				<para>After changing the Enrolment to TNC, you will need to go to the outcomes
					change them all to 'Did Not Start'. </para>
				<para>NOTE: Smart &amp; Skilled flavour exports will convert any outcome marked as
					Did not Start - 66 as two blank spaces for reporting. Did not Start - 66 is not
					a valid outcome code for Smart &amp; Skilled reporting. Outcomes code Did Not
					Start - 66 will only export a 66 as the code if reporting in OLiV Flavour. </para>
				<para>Once you have reported this enrolment, and had it accepted by State Training
					Services, you may wish to suppress it from future AVETMISS exports. If this is
					the case, on the general tab of the enrolment select the option 'Do not report
					for AVETMISS'.</para>
				<para>The field Purchasing Contract Identifier, which previously existed at the
					class level has also been added to the enrolment general tab, with the NSW
					specific label of Commitment ID. All outcomes in an enrolment will be reported
					with the same Commitment ID.</para>
				<para>The field Funding Source - State Training Authority field which was previously
					available at the class and outcome level has also been added to the enrolment
					general tab.</para>

				</mediaobject>
				<para>At the point in time the Smart &amp; Skilled export is run, any outcomes
					selected with a start date in the future will export with a two blank spaces in
					the place of the outcome identifier - national, regardless of what has been set
					in the database or in the export runner preferences. i.e. you can choose the
					option 'export 90 - not yet available for VET outcomes which are not set' and
					the Smart &amp; Skilled override for the two blank spaces will still apply where
					appropriate.</para>
				<para>An email address for all Smart &amp; Skilled students is mandatory. If the
					student does not have an email address, or has chosen not to provide one,
					onCourse will export notprovided@example.com.</para>

		</section>
		<section>
			<title>How to give your AVETMISS data to the people who want to pay you</title>
			<para>Either of the methods above will have created a folder on your computer with text
				files, all with funny names like NAT00080 and NAT00130. These are things you need to
				give to the government to get paid. Often, you will need to upload them to a website
				where they will be validated.</para>
			<para>For some types of lodgement you will also need to supply the NAT00085 file. This
				isn't outlined above, but is essentially the same as the NAT00080 but with your
				students personal addresses and other contact details. It will be automatically
				generated when you create an AVETMISS export. Be aware of the privacy implications
				of supplying this file to third parties. We suggest only supplying it when it is a
				requirement of your funding.</para>
			<para>Your local friendly funding body can help you from here on in if you encounter
				difficulties with their lodgement process. Customers with onCourse support plans can
				also log a task in squish for additional assistance.</para>

		<title>Validating and correcting AVETMISS errors</title>
		<para>Prior to exporting your AVETMISS data, you may wish to run some reports inside
			onCourse to check the values you have set. These reports can also be useful
			organisational data for other reporting and segmenting of your VET delivery.</para>
		<para>From the classes window, two CSV exports are available. CSV files can be opened in
			Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet applications. If you ever wished you could easily
			open and read NAT00120 files in Excel, consider this the next best thing.</para>
		<para>Begin by opening the classes window and locating the classes you wish to export,
			through the usual sorts, searches and filters. Once you have located and highlighted the
			classes in the list view choose File > Import/Export > Export Classes</para>
		<para>From the export format list options, choose either 'class outcomes CSV report' or
			'extended outcomes CSV'.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Class Outcomes CSV</title>
			<para>The purpose of this export is to show you all the outcomes and the outcome status
				of the enrolments associated with the classes you've exported. This can be a useful
				way to locate outcomes where the end date has passed but a final result has not yet
				been entered into onCourse.</para>
			<para>This report contains the onCourse student number, student first and last name,
				course-class code, unit of competency code and name, outcome start and end date and
				outcome status.</para>
			<para>Keep in mind this report is showing you the actual data in the onCourse records -
				when you export actual AVETMISS data from onCourse, the export runner values will
				set outcome status 90 for outcomes in progress, and outcome status 70 for outcomes
				that end in future calendar years. The value inside the database will remain as not
				set.</para>

			<title>Where do I enter the State Funding Codes in onCourse for the state where I am
				reporting to?</title>
			<para>There are two places where you can set your State Funding Source codes. The first
				in on the VET tab of the class. This is a useful place to set the code when all (or
				most) of the students in the class have the same funding source applying to
				them.</para>
			<para>First you will need to make sure you have an up to date list of the appropriate
				State Funding Codes to use within your reporting state. onCourse doesn't maintain a
				list of these codes, you will need to contact your local reporting officer to obtain
				this information.</para>

			</mediaobject>
			<para>If a student has a different funding code which applies to them, you can just
				change their enrolment funding codes to make it different to the one set at the
				class level. If all students in the class have different funding codes, you don't
				need to set anything at the class level, but can set each outcome separately on the
				enrolment general tab. </para>
			<para>Where the value populates from a record level above, you will see the value in the
				lower level record with the lock icon. In this case, it means the enrolment is
				inheriting the value from the level above, the class. You can click the unlock icon
				to change the value and break the inherited linked value from the class.</para>

			<title>How do I record a student's outcome who has completed a different elective from
				the rest of class?</title>
			<para>Once you have set up the outcomes at the Course level, every student enrolling in
				a Class from that Course will have all of the outcomes applied to their record. If a
				student chooses a different elective from the one you have set a the course level
				you can change their outcome so it is linked to a different Unit of

			<title>How do I record information about a clients traineeship?</title>
			<para>When a student is completing a traineeship, you will have been given a 'Training
				Contract Identifier' and a Client 'Identifier' by your state funding body. They may
				call them by different names, but the important thing to confirm is that they are
				the data that exports into the NAT000120 in positions 70 &amp; 80
				respectively.</para>
			<para>This data is entered into the onCourse enrolment window. This data will need to be
				entered after enrolment by going to the Enrolment window, locating the student's
				enrolment record and double clicking on it. On the general tab you will find these
				fields.</para>
			<para>In NSW, you will need to put your Training Contract ID into BOTH of these fields,
				as NSW doesn't issue a separate Client Identifier for trainees.</para>
			<para>If you have broken the traineeship into multiple enrolments, each with one or more
				units of competency, you will need to enter this information into each enrolment
				record for the student that relates to the traineeship. This information is not
				recorded as part of the student's master contact record, as the student may also
				have other enrolment records which don't form part of this traineeship.</para>

			<title>Why do some outcomes in the NAT000120 export with start and end dates of
				00000000?</title>
			<para>This is a date that has not been defined, e.g. instead of exporting an eight digit
				date like 01012012, it has exported no date, or a string of zeros as
				placeholders.</para>
			<para>What this means is that the class the outcome belongs to has no sessions defined.
				With no sessions, there are no start or end dates available. Also, if you have a
				self paced class where you have not defined the duration, the start date will be the
				date of enrolment as usual, but the end date will default to 12 months after the
				start date.</para>
			<para>Look for any unscheduled or self paced classes in your onCourse records, and add
				either some session information or manual start and end dates to each outcome in the
				class.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Why, in the AVETMISS export, do my non-VET courses have codes like ISH123?</title>
			<para>In onCourse version 5.0 we increased the Course Code field length to 32
				characters, to give onCourse Web users more SEO choices for the URL that was created
				for their course page.</para>
			<para>The AVETMISS standard NAT00060 allows for up to 12 characters in the 'subject identifier
				text'. We also have some users who have to report to other government bodies which
				further restrict them to using 8 or 10 of these available characters only as they
				append their own codes to this field.</para>
			<para>While we require course codes in onCourse to be unique, if we only exported the
				first 8 characters of user defined course code, we could very easily end up
				exporting two courses with duplicate codes that then causes an AVETMISS validation
				error. Take, for example course codes ComputerClassSeniors and ComputerClassOpen,
				both which are valid in onCourse and create good URLs like
				www.mycollegename.com.au/course/ComputerClassSeniors and
				www.mycollegename.com.au/course/ComputerClassOpen. </para>
			<para>Exporting the first 8, 10 or 12 characters for these courses would give us the
				identical code 'Computer', 'ComputerCl' or 'ComputerClas', all of which would be
				duplicates. Instead of this possible duplication, we export a made up code that will
				look something like ISH123 and will not ever create duplicate records in the export. </para>
			<para>Keep in mind, that for courses that aren't linked to training packages, the code
				reported in AVETMISS here has no meaning at all - it just has to be a unique
				identifier within your organisation. These 'made up' codes only affect your non-VET
				courses - real VET enrolments are always referenced to the unit(s) of competency
				they student enrolled in</para>
			<para>This does mean if you need to follow up another sort of validation error
				referencing an enrolment in ISH123 you'll need to check your NAT00060 export file to
				see that ISH123, for example is the export code for the course with the name
				'Introduction to Computers for Seniors'.</para>
			<para>As always, we walk the line in meeting the best business, sales and marketing
				functions for your college AND meeting the AVETMISS requirements in the most
				non-onerous way we can. Where these two needs conflict, we will try and code our way
				around it in the export process so we that don't stop you doing what you want in the

			<title>How does prior learning affect AVETMISS reports?</title>
			<para>Prior learning records only export from AVETMISS exports run from the file >
				import/export >export AVETMISS menu option. They will not export from the cogwheel
				option in the classes or enrolments window, because they are not associated with
				either a class or an enrolment, but instead are attached directly to the
				student.</para>
			<para>When you create a prior learning record with one or more outcomes attached, and the start
				and end dates of the prior learning outcomes fall into the 'outcomes after' to
				-'outcomes before' date range set in the AVETMISS export runner, then the data
				associated with the prior learning record will export.</para>
			<para>At a minimum, to create successful AVETMISS files your prior learning outcomes
				need, in addition to a start date and end date, an outcome status. All other values
				are optional.</para>
			<para>If a Delivery Mode is not set, 'classroom based' will export as the default,
				unless the outcome has an RPL status, in which case the delivery mode ' not
				applicable' will export.</para>
			<para>If the Funding Source - national is not set, then the default funding source set
				in the college preferences will be applied.</para>
			<para>If the prior learning record was linked to a qualification or skills set, then the
				Commencing Program Identifier will export as '3 - commencing enrolment', otherwise
				it will export as '8 - module only enrolment'. </para>
			<para>If the prior learning record was linked to a qualification or skills set, then the
				Study Reason Identifier will export as '11 - other reasons'.</para>
			<para>The VET in Schools flag will always export as No.</para>
			<para>The training location for all prior learning outcomes will be set to your college
				default administration site address.</para>
