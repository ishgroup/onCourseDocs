		<title>Setting up a course for online Eligibility Checks and Applications for Commitment
			IDs</title>
		<para>onCourse has developed processes that allow you to collect the student's information and
			lodge it with State Training Services using the STSOnline provider portal. You will need
			ensure the following set up at the course level before you can proceed. </para>
		<section>
			<title>General Course Set Up</title>
			<para>To enable online Eligibility Checks and applications for Commitment IDs for Smart and
				Skilled courses, you will need a course for Smart and Skilled  that is set up as
				visible online and enrolment by application. </para>

			<para>If you have Fee for Service and Smart and Skilled enrolments in public classes,
				you may decide to complete the eligibility check for each applicant. This means you
				will set up the same course for the qualification or skills set, and have all
				prospective students apply for a Smart and Skilled Quote. If your classes are
				primarily Smart and Skilled enrolments this is the best option. </para>
			<para>Some providers will have  a range of Fee for Service and Smart and Skilled
				enrolment in the class. If you are providing both you may decide to have two course
				set up, one for Smart and Skilled that is by application, and one for your Fee for
				Service class that is enrolment enabled. If you do have two course, you will need to
				consider your strategy with classes, and whether you will have to lots of classes
				available. This is generally more complex than taking all students by application
				and providing them with a Quote, and we suggest you contact our support team to talk
				through the options before you proceed with this set up. </para>
			<para>Most providers with Smart and Skilled funding for a qualification or skills set
				have the course set up by application to give the student the option to take up the
				Smart and Skilled funding if it's available to them. This will allow students to
				make the decision to take up the Smart and Skilled funding after they have received
				the details of the Quote.</para>
			<para>If the student is does not wish to accept the Smart and Skilled Quote, and you can
				enrolment them as a Fee for Service using the same application process as the Smart
				and Skilled enrolments. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Update the Terms and Conditions Page</title>
			<para>You will need to ensure you have collected express consent for the student's data to be
				used in the provider calculator. To do this, you will need to update your terms and
				conditions page on the website to include the consent to use the data collected in
				application or enrolment for the purpose of determining the student's eligibility
				where the application is for a Smart and Skilled program.</para>
			<para>Details of the requirement for prospective students' consent are under Section 6
				the "Smart and Skilled Operating Guidelines", with draft wording provided in
				Schedule 1 of the same document. The Smart and Skilled Operating Guidelines are
				available to providers on the STSonline provider portal.</para>
			<para>Details of how to <link linkend="terms">update your terms and conditions</link> is located
