	<section xml:id="intro_smartandSkilled"><title>What is Smart and Skilled?</title>
		<para>Smart and Skilled is a state based funding program provided by the NSW State
			government and administered by State Training Services. Details of the program are
			available on the Smart and Skilled Website <link
				xlink:href="https://smartandskilled.nsw.gov.au/for-training-providers"/></para>
		<para>This funded training activity uses a State based variation of the AVETMISS standard to
			report and reconcile data for payment to training providers. It is important to ensure
			you set up your onCourse records correctly to export your data in the correct format to
			receive prompt payment for your training delivery.</para>
		<para>The Smart and Skilled contracts require you to lodge your compliant training files (NAT
			Files) every 28 days. This is known as progressive or ongoing reporting. This type of
			reporting is designed capture progression information about a student i.e. commencement,
			progression, and eventually, their complete qualification or skills group. </para>
		<para>State Training Services will pay a percentage of the total contract amount at key
			points in the reporting, such as </para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Commencement - the enrolment is reported with a commitment ID and at least one
					outcome reported as 70 - Continuing Enrolment.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem><para>Progression - one or more claims paid when the enrolment is reported with
				required milestones (i.e. started and completed outcomes). Please refer to Smart
				&amp; Skilled Operating Guidelines for details, different qualifications have
				different progression milestone and payment amounts. NOTE: The milestones include
				those who withdrew after they started their training, and you may be able to claim
				progression payments when the student withdraws.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Completion - the enrolment  reported with a final status for all outcomes and
				a complete record in the NAT00130 file. Completion payments are only paid if the
				student has been issued with the qualification, and not if the student is withdrawn.</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>Key differences when using progressive reporting are<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>You are expected to report all the outcomes in the qualification with each
						batch of NAT Files, including outcomes that are not yet  started or did not
						start. e.g. for a Diploma of Business with eight units of competency,
						initial lodgement of data will have one outcome as 70 - Continuing
						Enrolment, and seven outcomes as 85 - Not Yet Started. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>As the student progresses through the training, their outcomes statuses
						are updated. Claims will be paid based on their level of progression. e.g.
						for a Diploma of Business with eight units of competency,the progression
						claim is paid after move the 4 outcomes are reported as 70 - Continuing
						Enrolment and at least one outcome is reported as 20 - Competent. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> Smart &amp; Skilled reporting does not rely on calendar year. If you
						don't report completion or withdrawal data, the student will remain active.
					</para>

			</orderedlist>
		</para>

		<para>The National AVETMISS reporting specification was originally designed to report training
			completion after the fact i.e. at the end of the calender year, and shoehorning this
			standard into a continual reporting framework takes continual effort on the part of STS
			and software vendors like ish to find new and creative ways to report your data in a way
			that requires the least amount of effort on your part.</para>
		<section>
		<title>Smart and Skilled in onCourse - Course set up for reporting </title>
		<para>onCourse contains a number of features and functions to smooth your reporting journey.
			Many can be set up to help you manage the often complex requirements for Smart &amp;
			Skilled reporting. </para>
		<para>Ideally, you will create courses for Smart and Skilled enrolments that contain all the
			outcomes for the qualification or skill set in the course level. This will then mean you
			have only one enrolment to report for each student, and that single enrolment will
			contain all the outcomes for the student's funded course.</para>
		<para>Some providers will choose to make multiple courses for reporting their Smart and
			Skilled students for operational reasons. In those instances, the Commitment ID and
			Funding Source will need to be added to every enrolment that contains outcomes for the
			student. These enrolments may represent clusters of outcomes, or single outcomes. </para>
		<para>The instructions given in this documentation assume that one enrolment per student is
			the norm, but you can adapt these instructions as needed to your environment.</para>
		</section>
			<section>
			<title>Setting up Reporting for Skills Groups</title>
			<para>Skills Group are special 'made up' Skill Sets or mini qualifications that have
				been invented by STS to allow funding for clusters of units under the Smart and
				Skilled funding program.</para>
			<para>onCourse includes by default all official training package and accredited course
				qualifications from Training.gov.au, but not the Skills Groups. The Skills Groups
				codes are created by STSOnline on an ad hoc basis, they need to be manually entered
				in the onCourse qualification database as you receive the funding contact and before
				you try to report the student.</para>
			<para><emphasis role="bold">It is important you do this as early as possible in the
					process as so not to hold up your reporting.</emphasis></para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>When you receive a Skills Group contract, it will include a code like
						SG00001234</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Go to <link xlink:href="https://squish.ish.com.au">the onCourse support portal</link> and
						log a new task requesting the addition of the code</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><para>ish support staff will schedule the addition of the code which may take
					around 48 hours to propagate to your onCourse database. An email will be sent to
					notify you of the addition</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Once the code has been added, it will be available for you to add to your
					course on the VET tab national code field</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Make sure you tick the option 'Satisfies complete qualification of skill
					set' to ensure the data is correctly reported for these students as an enrolment
					in a mini qual, rather than a standalone set of units.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Add the units the Skills Group funding covers to the course and save the
					course</para></listitem>
				</orderedlist>
			<para>IMPORTANT: If you don't have the Skills Group added to onCourse when you
				set up the course, you can still set up the course and enrol the student. The
				Skills Group code and tick box can be added later, after enrolment if needed.
				All this information affects is AVETMISS reporting and Certification
				defaults.</para>

			<title>Data Collection Set Up</title>
			<para>Data collection rules and forms allow you to define what information is collected
				during the online enrolment, application and waiting list process.</para>
			<para>Before you set up your Smart and Skilled courses you may want to consider if there is a
				need to set up a special set of forms and rules for your Smart &amp; Skilled
				program. </para>
			<para>You can create custom fields and forms for using the Data Collection feature, and assigned
				them to particular courses, which can assist with the individual requirements of
				your contact. You can read more about Data Collection in the <link

			<title>Funding Contact Set Up</title>
			<para>To streamline the reporting process, ensure you have enabled the Smart and Skilled
				funding contract.</para>
			<para>Smart and Skilled is a default funding contact in onCourse. Instructions on activating the
				default contacts are found <link xlink:href="fundingContract.html#fundingContract">in
					our Funding Contracts chapter</link>. You can also add additional funding
				contracts if you want to split your Smart and Skilled reporting into smaller
				subgroups, managed by different parts of the business.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Course and Class Set Up</title>
			<para>There are a few setting you will need to use if you want to take advantage of the
				full range of Smart and Skilled features in onCourse. These features will assist you
				in collecting the data required and reporting it in a timely manner. It is expected
				that you are already familiar with the standard course and class set up process
				before you read this documentation about the specific Smart and Skilled set up
				requirements.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Course General Tab</title>
				<para>Every course in onCourse can be either 'Enrolment by Application' or 'Open
					Enrolment'. This enrolment type determines how students can interact with the
					course on the web. A course that is open enrolment allows students to enrol and
					pay directly. A course that is Enrolment by Application allows for a second
					level of checks, for example, to check a student meets the funding requirements,
					prior to proceeding to enrolment.</para>
				<para>To enable online Eligibility Checks and applications for Commitment IDs for
					Smart and Skilled courses, you will need a course for Smart and Skilled that is
					set up as visible online and enrolment by application. </para>

					<para>If you have Fee for Service and Smart and Skilled enrolments in the same
						class, you may decide to complete the eligibility check for each applicant.
						This means you will set up the same course for the qualification or skills
						set, and have all prospective students apply for a Smart and Skilled Quote.
						If your classes are primarily Smart and Skilled enrolments this is the best
						option. </para>
					<para>Some providers will have a range of Fee for Service and Smart and Skilled
						enrolment in the class. If you are providing both you may decide to have two
						courses set up, one for Smart and Skilled that is by application, and one
						for your Fee for Service class that is 'open enrolment'. If you do have two
						courses, you will need to consider your strategy with classes, and whether
						you will have lots of classes available. This is generally more complex than
						taking all students by application and providing them with a Quote, and we
						suggest you contact our support team to talk through the options before you
						proceed with this set up. </para>
					<para>Most providers with Smart and Skilled funding for a qualification or
						skills set have the course set up by application to give the student the
						option to take up the Smart and Skilled funding if it's available to them.
						This will allow students to make the decision to take up the Smart and
						Skilled funding after they have received the details of the Quote.</para>
					<para>If the student is does not wish to accept the Smart and Skilled Quote, and
						you can enrolment them as a Fee for Service using the same application
						process as the Smart and Skilled enrolments. </para>

			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Smart and Skilled claims are paid 6 weeks or 42 days of the successful

			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Smart and Skilled reporting is progressive rather than by calendar year. If a
