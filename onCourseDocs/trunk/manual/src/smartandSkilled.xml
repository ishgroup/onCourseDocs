			<para>If you have Fee for Service and Smart and Skilled enrolments in public classes,
				you may decide to complete the eligibility check for each applicant. This means you
				will set up the same course for the qualification or skills set, and have all
				prospective students apply for a Smart and Skilled Quote. If your classes are
				primarily Smart and Skilled enrolments this is the best option. </para>
			<para>Some providers will have a range of Fee for Service and Smart and Skilled
				enrolment in the class. If you are providing both you may decide to have two course
				set up, one for Smart and Skilled that is by application, and one for your Fee for
				Service class that is enrolment enabled. If you do have two course, you will need to
				consider your strategy with classes, and whether you will have to lots of classes
				available. This is generally more complex than taking all students by application
				and providing them with a Quote, and we suggest you contact our support team to talk
				through the options before you proceed with this set up. </para>
			<para>Most providers with Smart and Skilled funding for a qualification or skills set
				have the course set up by application to give the student the option to take up the
				Smart and Skilled funding if it's available to them. This will allow students to
				make the decision to take up the Smart and Skilled funding after they have received
				the details of the Quote.</para>
			<para>If the student is does not wish to accept the Smart and Skilled Quote, and you can
				enrolment them as a Fee for Service using the same application process as the Smart
				and Skilled enrolments. </para>

			<title>Update the Terms and Conditions Page</title>
			<para>You will need to ensure you have collected express consent for the student's data
				to be used in the provider calculator. To do this, you will need to update your
				terms and conditions page on the website to include the consent to use the data
				collected in application or enrolment for the purpose of determining the student's
				eligibility where the application is for a Smart and Skilled program.</para>
			<para>Details of the requirement for prospective students' consent are under Section 6
				the "Smart and Skilled Operating Guidelines", with draft wording provided in
				Schedule 1 of the same document. The Smart and Skilled Operating Guidelines are
				available to providers on the STSonline provider portal.</para>
			<para>Details of how to update your terms and conditions is located in our web

<para>Smart and Skilled reporting differs from Total VET Activity Reporting in a number of way<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Smart and Skilled reporting is ongoing rather than by calendar year. If a

						be reported again in that year. If a student's enrolment is ongoing then you
						are expected to report new activity. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>STSOnline expects new activity to be lodged within 28 days i.e. if a
						student start a new unit of competency that should be reporting within 28
						days of the start</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>STSOnline expect a lodgement of Smart and Skilled Student data every 28
						days. You do not have report all data every 28 days, only new data or
						changes. </para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Smart and Skilled enrolments can be reported as individuals, groups,
						classes, etc. You are not required to report a full batch of data for each
						upload. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>STSOnline limits you to three uploads a day, so if you need to correct an

				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Smart and Skilled payments are due with 6 weeks or 42 days of the
						lodgement of data, so it's within your RTO's best interests to do smaller,
						more frequent lodgements than to wait for once a month. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>At the point in time the Smart &amp; Skilled export is run, any outcomes
						selected with a start date in the future will export with a two blank spaces
						in the place of the outcome identifier - national, regardless of what has
						been set in the database or in the export runner preferences. i.e. you can
						choose the option 'export 70 - continuing enrolment for VET outcomes which
						are not set' and the Smart &amp; Skilled override for the two blank spaces
