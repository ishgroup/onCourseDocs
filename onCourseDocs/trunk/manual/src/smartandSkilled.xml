		<title>What is Smart and Skilled?</title>
		<para>Smart and Skilled is a state based funding program provided by the NSW State
			government and administered by State Training Services. Details of the program are
			available on the Smart and Skilled Website <link

		<title>Data Collection Set Up</title>
		<para>You can create custom fields and forms for using the Data Collection feature, and
			assigned them to particular courses, which can assist with the individual requirements
			of your contact. Please read more in <xref linkend="dataCollection"/></para>

		<title>Funding Contact Set Up</title>
		<para>Smart and Skilled is a default funding contact in onCourse. Instructions on activating

		<title>Course and Class Set Up</title>
		<para>There are a few setting you will need to use if you want to take advantage of the full
			range of Smart and Skilled features in onCourse. These features will assist you in
			collecting the data required and reporting it in a timely manner. </para>
		<section>
			<title>Course General Tab</title>
			<para>To enable online Eligibility Checks and applications for Commitment IDs for Smart
				and Skilled courses, you will need a course for Smart and Skilled that is set up as
				visible online and enrolment by application. </para>
			<section>
				<para>If you have Fee for Service and Smart and Skilled enrolments in public
					classes, you may decide to complete the eligibility check for each applicant.
					This means you will set up the same course for the qualification or skills set,
					and have all prospective students apply for a Smart and Skilled Quote. If your
					classes are primarily Smart and Skilled enrolments this is the best option. </para>
				<para>Some providers will have a range of Fee for Service and Smart and Skilled
					enrolment in the class. If you are providing both you may decide to have two
					courses set up, one for Smart and Skilled that is by application, and one for
					your Fee for Service class that is enrolment enabled. If you do have two
					courses, you will need to consider your strategy with classes, and whether you
					will have lots of classes available. This is generally more complex than taking
					all students by application and providing them with a Quote, and we suggest you
					contact our support team to talk through the options before you proceed with
					this set up. </para>
				<para>Most providers with Smart and Skilled funding for a qualification or skills
					set have the course set up by application to give the student the option to take
					up the Smart and Skilled funding if it's available to them. This will allow
					students to make the decision to take up the Smart and Skilled funding after
					they have received the details of the Quote.</para>
				<para>If the student is does not wish to accept the Smart and Skilled Quote, and you
					can enrolment them as a Fee for Service using the same application process as
					the Smart and Skilled enrolments. </para>

		<title>eReporting to STSOnline</title>
		<para>Smart and Skilled reporting differs from Total VET Activity Reporting in a number of ways;<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Smart and Skilled reporting is ongoing rather than by calendar year. If a
						student completes and has their final data approved they are not expected to
						be reported again in that year. If a student's enrolment is ongoing then you
						are expected to report new activity. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>STSOnline expects new activity to be lodged within 28 days i.e. if a
						student starts a new unit of competency that should be reporting within 28
						days of the start</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>STSOnline expects a  Smart and Skilled  lodgement every 28 days. You do
						not have report all data every 28 days, only new data or changes. </para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Smart and Skilled enrolments can be reported as individuals, groups,
						classes, etc. You are not required to report a full batch of data for each
						upload. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>STSOnline limits you to three uploads a day, so if you need to correct an
						error, you may need to wait until the next day to do another upload.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Smart and Skilled payments are due with 6 weeks or 42 days of the
						lodgement of data, so it's within your RTO's best interests to do smaller,
						more frequent lodgements than to wait for once a month. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>At the point in time the Smart &amp; Skilled export is run, any outcomes
						selected with a start date in the future will export with two blank spaces
						in the place of the outcome identifier - national, regardless of what has
						been set in the database or in the export runner preferences. i.e. you can
						choose the option 'export 70 - continuing enrolment for VET outcomes which
						are not set' and the Smart &amp; Skilled override for the two blank spaces
						will still apply where appropriate.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist></para>
		<para>For more information please refer to the "Smart and Skilled eReporting Technical
			Specifications and Business Validations" available to providers on the STSonline
			provider portal.</para>
		<title>Cancellations or deferrals</title>
		<para>Smart and Skilled enrolment has specific reporting requirements for cancellations or
			deferrals. </para>
		<para>In the  'Outcome identifier - Training Organisation' field you will need to record
			Training not completed (TNC) or Training Deferred (D) value for the enrolment. </para>
		<para>For the Deferred enrolment, you will need to change the outcome start and end dates to
			the expected future dates. </para>
		<para>For Training not completed, you will need to go to the outcomes change them all to
			'Did not Start - 66 '. </para>
		<para>NOTE: STSOnline (NSW) flavour exports will convert outcomes set as Did not Start - 66
			as two blank spaces as Did not Start - 66 is not a valid outcome code for Smart &amp;
			Skilled reporting. </para>
		<para>The Training not completed information will need to be lodged and accepted by
			STSOnline. Once accepted by STSOnline, will need to suppress it from future AVETMISS
			exports by checking the option 'Do not report for AVETMISS' on general tab of the
			enrolment.</para>

		<title>Eligibility Checks and Provider Calculator</title>
		<para>onCourse has developed processes that allow you to collect the student's information
			and lodge it with State Training Services using the STSOnline provider portal. You will
			need to ensure the following set up at the course level before you can proceed. </para>
		<section>
			<title>Update the Terms and Conditions Page on the Website</title>
			<para>You will need to ensure you have collected express consent for the student's data
				to be used in the provider calculator. To do this, you will need to update your
				terms and conditions page on the website to include the consent to use the data
				collected in application or enrolment to determine the student's eligibility where
				the application is for a Smart and Skilled program.</para>
			<para>Details of the requirement for prospective students' consent are under Section 6
				the "Smart and Skilled Operating Guidelines", with draft wording provided in
				Schedule 1 of the same document. The "Smart and Skilled Operating Guidelines" are

				<title>Editing the Bulk Upload Template for Eligibility Checks</title>
				<para>The bulk upload template will need to be edited before you can upload it via
					the STSOnline provider portal. </para>
				<para>Certain fields are mandatory and must be completed for a successful upload.
					Some fields are conditional and only need to be completed if another field has a
					value. A few fields are optional and do not need to be completed for he
					Eligibility checks.</para>
				<para>Full details of the fields and their specifications are found in the "Smart
					and Skilled Provider Calculator Data Specifications and User Guide Multiple
					Student Process" available from the STSOnline provider portal. </para>
				<para>onCourse has added values where applicable from the student, employer, course
					or class and included some default values for fields as details below, however,
					the provider will need to confirm that they are accurate and correct for each
					upload. </para>
				<para>All values in the export will need to be reviewed and verified by the
					operators to ensure it's compliant. You should consult the documentation on the
					STSOnline provider portal for specific information. </para>
				<para>We recommend you download the "Smart and Skilled Provider Calculator Data
					Specifications and User Guide Multiple Student Process" Table 1 Bulk Upload file
					and confirm the values you will need to enter with your compliance team or
					management before you do your first upload. </para>
				<para>Please make sure to check that the dates are formatted as DD/MM/YYY for all
					date columns, some spreadsheet programs will change the date formats when the
					file is opened. </para>
				<para>If you encounter issues with the upload failing or student not being accepted,
					you will need to contact Training Market for assistance: <link
