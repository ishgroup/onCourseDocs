		<title>Using Tags</title>
		<para>Tags can be created and added by navigating to "File" -> "Preferences" -> "Tags". This will
			bring up a list of Tag groups. Tags are flexible ways for you to categorise your data
			and organise the navigation of your website. </para>
		<para>You can create a Tag group which may contain any number of arbitrary tags, choose to which
			pieces of information such as Courses, Classes, Students etc, that you wish to apply it
			to, whether it's mandatory for all records to have a tag, and if you want to limit each
			record to only one tag from within this tag group. </para>

		<para>The tag preferences edit view also allows a user to apply a sort order to those tags. If you
			wish to display the tags in a given order, you simply drag and drop a given tag item
			within a group to the place in the hierarchy you wish it to go. </para>
		<para>In the following screen image, by hi-lighting a given tag within the list, you can then drag and drop that tag into another position in the overall list. This tag display order will also be mimicked on your onCourse website for tags under the "Subjects" tag group</para>

		<section>
			<title>Subjects Tag Group</title>
		<para>The main tag group, used to drive your website and in the export of courses and classes for
				print production, is the "Subjects" tag group. You can create the subjects that are
				appropriate for your college, and any sub categories needed. You can decide if
				tagging is mandatory or optional, and if courses can have more than one tag. Giving
				courses multiple tags mean they can be listed in multiple place on your website. For
				example, an MYOB course could be tagged with both 'Accounting' and
				'Computers'.</para>
		<para>You can add any number of tags by clicking on the "+" icon. To add a subcategory tag, first
				click on a tag to select it and then click once again on the "+" icon.</para>	
		<para>When setting up your subject tags, it is advisable to only apply these subject tags to
			courses and not to classes, students or sites. The reason for this relates back to the
			hierarchical structure of the subject tag and the information that is connected back to a
			course.</para>
		<para>For example, a course within the database will have a class connected to it and within
			that class you would have a tutor assigned, room allocated and students enrolled in that
			class. What this means from a filtering perspective within the database, is that by merely
			applying a subject tag to a course, when you apply the filter of the subject tag within any
			window, any information such as class or student or tutor or site which is connected back to a
			tagged course, will automatically be displayed.</para>
		<para>To further illustrate this, in the following image, you can see in the class window, the
			information has been filtered by the "general dentistry" subject tag. So even though the
			classes listed are not tagged with that "general dentistry" subject tag, because these classes
			all relate to a course that has been given the '"general dentistry" subject tag, they will
			display automatically.</para>

			<title>Tags as Filtering Tool within onCourse Client</title>
			<para>The tags that display within the left hand pane of a given window, provide the user with a number of different options in terms of searching and sorting of information. You can utilise the tags within the a window in a number of ways:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Use the tags to filter / view records within a given window. You can also use your tags
							within advanced search by use of the search parameter of "tagged with
							(including children)". This means the search will include any records
							which have been tagged with second or third level tags within the
							hierarchy (also known as "children")</para></listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Expand and collapse a given tag group within the left hand pane by clicking on the name of the tag group (show / hide)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Tag groups for courses and classes are shown twice as filter options in the contact window, once for filtering students enrolled in, and a second time to filter for tutors teaching classes that are tagged with that tag option.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Tags on your onCourse Website</title>
		<para>This same logic of displaying all related information from a tagged course, is also
			utilized on your website, so when you click on "general dentistry" on your website, those
			courses with that tag and all related classes, tutor and room information will automatically
			be displayed, without the need to apply that subject tag to any other piece of data within the
			database, other than the course. </para>
		<para>The subject tag group also has a special meaning when used as a filter within the contacts
			window. When used in conjunction to the core student filters, it means "show all students
			enrolled in classes that belong to courses tagged with....". When used in conjunction with the
			tutor core filters it means "show all tutors assigned to classes that belong to courses tagged
			with....". </para>
		<para>If you apply the tag directly to contact records as well as courses, the meaning of the
			filter will change to also include the meaning above "AND show me all the contacts tagged
			with" which can lead to a returned results list that doesn't make much sense to the user.
		</para>
	</section>	
		<section>
			<title>Tagging as it relates to the Website URL</title>
			<para>The URL for the subject tag group is /courses/subjects. This URL will contain any
				information that has been added in the 'Detail' field for the Subjects root tag. </para>
			<para>If you set up a first level tag within the subjects tag group which is entitled "Arts", the
				URL for that tag on your website would display as /courses/arts.</para>
			<para>You can also display second and third level tag hierarchy within the URL, here is an
				example of a second level tag entitled "Photography" under the Arts tag:
				courses/arts/photography.</para>
			<para>Whilst the default tag structure for website URL's are set to recognize tags under the
				Subjects tag group, you can also apply first level tags from other tag groups, as
				long as you define the tag group as being <guilabel>web visible</guilabel>. An
				example of utilising a different tag group within a URL would be as follows:
				/courses/VET.</para>
			<note>
				<para>Within the tag group edit view window, you can change the URL path of the tag name. To
					change the default URL path, simply click on the padlock next to the field
						<guilabel>URL path</guilabel> then edit what you want the URL path to be. So
					in the example below the URL is being changed from /courses/Creative+Arts to
					/courses/Arts.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Utilizing Tag Web Descriptions</title>
			<para>Just as the Courses and Classes flow through via the website from whichever Subjects tag
				you attach via onCourse, you can also add a tag web description, which will display
				on your website at the top of the course list for that tag. </para>
		<para>As you can see in the above image, in order to display the web description and any images you may attach, you need to do the following:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Flag the tag as <guilabel>web visible</guilabel>within the tag set up.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Using rich text, enter the information, description of the tag into the
							<guilabel>detail</guilabel>field for that tag.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>You can also add images to the tag web description by uploading the image to onCourse via
						the <guilabel>Resources > Attachments</guilabel>menu. </para>
					<para>For more information about rich text and adding images, refer to the <link xlink:href="http://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/web/richText.html">rich text</link> chapter of the User Handbook.</para>

		<title>A flexible way to add classification and structure to your data</title>
		<para>Did you ever want a program to classify information in a way that was specific to your
			business, but found that it involved expensive modifications to the software? Not so
			with onCourse - you can structure your courses and classes in a way that suits your
			college. Like to organise and work with classes by term or semester? No problem. Want to
			classify classes by region or subject area? Easy. Need to separate tutors into those
			currently working for your college, those proposing new programs that haven't run yet
			and those held in reserve in case a regular staff member is absent? Can do. We call it
			tagging. You call it running your college and interacting with your business critical
			data in the most efficient way possible.</para>
		<para>The "tagging" concept for courses, classes, web pages and other content allows you to build
			rich ways to navigate through your data. You may wish to group all courses as part of a
			specific promotion and have that grouping display as a list on your web site. Or you may
			wish to have a purely internal classification of areas of responsibility for classes.
			Think of this like categories and subcategories which extend as many levels as you want
			and with much more flexibility, not just for the web site but for your internal use as
			well. </para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<title>Scenario 1:</title>

		<title>Creating a filter in advanced search to make tagging more powerful.</title>
		<para>You can create a filter that will list classes for a Term. You can create Tag Groups and
			sub-tags to achieve this, however you can also achieve the same result with less work:</para>
		<example>
			<title>How to create a Filter using Advanced Search: </title>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para> Click on the magnify glass in the top left-hand corner </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> In the Advanced Find window; - choose to Find records matching ALL of the following
						- Start date/time : after : [The day before the first day of term 1] - then click "Add
						Search Line" and set Start date/time : before : [The day after the last day of term 1]
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para> Click on the Cog Wheel, then choose Save Find, name the Find to "Term 1", you can
						choose to make this filter visible to yourself or, to all staff using onCourse, then
						click Save.</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>If you receive the following message: "There are X records linked to this tag. Making this
				tag mandatory can cause those records XX_XX to become invalid, are you sure you want
				to proceed?", you should select no. It's best to avoid making any classes invalid. </para>
			<para>In this case, we would recommend not making the tag mandatory initially, then going to
				all classes and tagging them with the relevant term. Once all classes have been tagged with
				a term, then you can go back to your tag settings and make it mandatory. </para>
