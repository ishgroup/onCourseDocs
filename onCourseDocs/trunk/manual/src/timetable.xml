	    <title>Chapter Overview</title>
	    <para>When scheduling classes, it can be helpful to know at a glance when a room or a site 
	        might have some availability free to book up, or is booked out solidly for the next four weeks. 
	        onCourse allows you to track class sessions scheduled at both the site level, and the room level, 
	    making it easier to spot holes in their availability quickly and easily.</para>

        <title>Accessing Timetable View</title>
        <para>The Timetable view can be accessed from the Dashboard by typing 'Timetable' into the
            Find Anything search bar, or from within either a Site or a Room record. To find a
            timetable view for a specific site or room:</para>

        <title>Timetable Window</title>
        <para>The Timetable window features a mini-calendar marking today's date, the date selected and 
            any days with sessions booked, along with three separate time of day filters;
            before 12pm, 12pm-6pm, and after 6pm. Selecting any combination of these filters will
            filter out results that appear outside these parameters.</para>
        <para>You can also create custom filters using our Advanced Query Language, or AQL, a
            relatively simple but powerful way to search across numerous records in onCourse.</para>
        <para>You will always see a list of current sessions booked, the date, session length, 
            session times, site and room information, and the name of the sessions tutors, if they're set.</para>
        <para>Each class name can be clicked to open the applicable class record.</para>

        <title>Custom Timetable filters</title>
        <para>You can apply custom filters to the timetable utilising the onCourse advanced query
            language, which you can learn about in more detail here, <link
                xlink:href="search.html">in our search chapter</link>.</para>
        <para>To create a new search filter, make a selection from the drop down box in the search
            bar at the bottom of the window. You can choose from the following entities:</para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Sessions</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Tutors</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Contacts</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Classes</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Courses</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Student names</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Rooms</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Sites</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>Selections in the drop down box show which entities the data is connected across
            within the onCourse database. E.G. the courses selection appears like so:</para>
        <para><code>session.courseClass.course.</code></para>
        <para>Selecting this would allow you to create a filter that's quickly accessible from the
            custom filters section in the left-hand panel for anything related to courses, like
            which courses are on the specified date with the word "music" in its name.</para>
