		<title>onCourse Terms and Definitions</title>
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Contact</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>A person or company in onCourse is called a contact. Contact can be set as a
						Student, Tutor or Company, none of these or a combination of these.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Tutor</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>A tutor is a type of contact. A tutor is anyone who teaches a class for, or on
						behalf of, your college. They may be an employee or a contractor, and could also be a
						student of your college who is enrolled in classes.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Student</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>A student enrols in classes. A contact or tutor who enrols in a class will
						automatically be set as a student (in addition to being a tutor).</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Company</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>A company contact is a business, not an individual. Companies may also be set as
						tutors, for example, you may contract to have ACME Tennis Coaching teach classes for
						your business. You can assign the company as the tutor of the class.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Relationship</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>Contacts can be related to each other. For example, a company that delivers courses
						for your college, may also have individual contact records set up for their staff that
						teach or assist with the sessions. These contacts would be set as employees of the
						company. By doing this you could advertise the class as being taught by the company,
						which would be the information that displays on your ish website, while also internally
						managing the individuals that would be booked to deliver each class session.</para>

		<subtitle>Navigating the list and record windows</subtitle>
		<para>All records in onCourse can be viewed in either a list view or record view. You need to
			open the list view to access individual records.</para>
		<para>To access the tutors records go to either the splash screen and click on
				<guibutton>Tutors</guibutton> or the onCourse menu <menuchoice>
				<guimenuitem>People</guimenuitem>
				<guisubmenu>Tutors</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice> . This will open the Tutors list view window.</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<title>The onCourse list view</title>
			<listitem>
				<para>Parts of the window - On the right hand part of the window are the course records
					listed in a summary view. The title bar shows you how many records you have. The top
					section of the window contains the search function and the add and delete records button.
					You will also find a cog wheel button that allows for special functions for one or more
					records in the list. In the left hand side of the list window are quick searches to enable
					you to work with groups of data.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Record summaries - The list of records in this window allows you to enter a record by
					double clicking, or select the record to perform special functions by single clicking. A
					selected record will be highlighted. You can select one or more records in the list by
					using shift-click to select a range, or control-click to select a group of individual
					records. </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Columns and sorting - Column headings can be used to sort records in the list. Click
					on the header to sort in alphabetical order. Click it again to sort by reverse
					alphabetical order. You can also drag the columns around and modify their width to set
					your preferred layout.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Quick search - By typing the first few letters of the Tutor's surname into the quick
					search field, you can reduce the list of records to those that match.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Advanced Search - Advanced search can be accessed by clicking on the Magnifying glass
					image in the quick search field. This will open the query editor to allow you to choose
					which fields and which data you want to search on. You can add multiple criteria to your
					searches.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Saved Searches - After performing an advanced search, you can choose to save the
					search parameters to allow you to quickly run the search again. To save a search, click on
					the cogwheel within the query editor and select 'save find'. The saved search will appear
					in the left hand part of the window.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Tag groups - Any tag groups you have created that relate to Tutors, like Subject, will
					appear here. By checking any of these check boxes you will see the list of records on the
					right hand side reduced to records that match that criteria. You can tag records in bulk
					by selecting a group of records on the right and right clicking on a tag name on the
					left.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Core filters - Core filters reduce the list of records to those that match the filter
					criteria. By default, most onCourse windows open with filters applied so you are only
					working with your current records. You can switch core filters on and off by ticking the
					checkboxes.</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<tip>
			<para>Filters and searches work together in onCourse. If you run an search and do not see the
				result you expect, this may be because a filter that is checked is preventing the record you
				are searching for from being displayed.</para>
		</tip>
		<para>You can enter a tutor record by double clicking on it in the window.</para>

		<title>Creating Tutors</title>
		<para>You will need to keep your tutor's contact details on file and what classes and sessions
			they are scheduled to teach each term. If you are an RTO you will also need to keep copies of
			their resume and qualifications on file. onCourse allows you to do this. Each tutor has their
			own personal file in onCourse which is easy to access and update. </para>
		<para>If you have a large number of casual staff who work at a variety of different venues, it
			can be difficult to manage communication with them as you might not see them in person very
			often. Tutors listed in onCourse can be emailed or SMS'd easily and all messages sent out of
			the system are tracked in the tutors record helping you to keep all communications listed and
			organised. onCourse is designed to help you manage your staff records with ease. </para>

						the courses they are teaching. As this information will be visible to
						students and general public on the website, it is recommended that you
						obtain permission from the tutor to publish this information. You can enter
						the text directly into the screen or cut and paste from another source. The
						text in the field can be formatted using Rich text. </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>

		<para>You may wish to notify individual tutors if their course is running or cancelled, or
			groups of tutors with information about activities and event at the College. If you create and
			send the message from onCourse, the history of the message is stored within the tutor's record
			on the messaged tab.</para>

				<para>Select the ‘send email' and/or ‘send SMS' box. If you choose to send both, you can
					also select the option under SMS ‘including people who are emailed'. If people have
					supplied both mobile number and email address, it is a cheaper option (and the default
					option) to just email them, and only SMS those who don't have email. However, sometimes
					you may wish to send both, just to make sure. While most of the time it only takes a few
					seconds to deliver an SMS, it is not an instantaneous technology, even if it often seems
					this way. It can take up to 3 days for an SMS to be delivered. This has to do with the
					phone carrier, something that ish has no control over, or because the user has their phone
					switched off.</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Enter the email subject in the <guilabel>subject</guilabel> field. This field is
					mandatory and the email cannot be sent unless you enter a subject. The same applies for

					reminder etc before the message can be sent. </para>
