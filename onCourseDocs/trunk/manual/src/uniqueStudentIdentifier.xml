        <title>What is the USI?</title>
        <para>On 1 January 2015 the Australian Commonwealth government introduced a Unique Student
            Identifier which will be issued to every student undertaking vocational training. Once a
            student has been issued a USI, they will supply this number to any RTO where they
            undertake training, be they short one day courses like First Aid,  year long full
            Qualification programs or anything in between. The training they undertake will be
            reported back to government through mandatory AVETMISS reporting and a combined training
            transcript created for the student showing all training attempts and completions
            undertaken throughout their life. If the student declines to provide their USI, the RTO
            is not permitted to issue their Statement of Attainment or Qualification on completion
            of training.</para>
        <para>Eventually a USI will be issued to every child starting primary school and every
            student at university. The USI is similar to existing identity systems already in place
            in Australia: medicare number, tax file number, driver's license, etc. but it is not
            printed on an identity card and it is illegal for RTOs to print them on student cards or
            certificates.</para>
        <para>The USI can only be issued in an automated fashion by the USI agency in response to a
            request from a student who comes with certain identification papers. Medicare cards,
            driver's licenses, birth certificates and passports are probably the most common forms
            of identification which can be used. Students without any official identification papers
            can be issued a USI though a manual request process.</para>

        <title>Requirements and limitations</title>
        <para>The USI legislation puts certain limitations on how the USI can be used and how it
            must be reported.<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The USI cannot be printed on certificates. None of the default
                        certificates or transcripts in onCourse include the USI.</para>

                    <para>You may not issue a certificate to a student until you have their USI and
                        have verified it. onCourse will allow you to create Certificate records but
                        not print them until the USI is verified. You can override this behaviour
                        with the appropriate administrator rights, but you must then ensure you have
                        implemented another verification process in your RTO.</para>

            <title>The onCourse USI process</title>
            <para>Our primary goal is to make obtaining and verifying USIs the responsibility of the
            enrolling student to minimise the data entry and management effort required by your
            office staff. </para>
        <para>We know that many organisations who use onCourse deliver a mix of accredited (VET) and
            non-accredited training, and that the USI requirements will not apply to their
            non-accredited students. We also know that some 75% of students who have ever enrolled
            via onCourse either have enrolled online or have provided an email address during the
            enrolment process, so can receive emails from us and access websites to complete web
            forms. </para>
        <para>First of all, when a student enrols in a course which is identified as a VET course,
            their enrolment confirmation will include some additional text explaining what a USI is
            and why they need to tell you theirs. This email directs them to a special onCourse
            portal page (no log in required) requesting they supply their USI or go through the
            process to create one. </para>
        <para>Most students will be going through the process of creating a new USI. Once they
            complete this part of the process, we will then take that new USI and verify it against
            their first name, last name and date of birth as supplied on enrolment. If the USI
            doesnâ€™t validate (possibly because the student used a dummy date of birth on enrolment,
            or a shortened version of their first name) then they will be prompted to update the
            incorrect data in onCourse to match their USI, so we can pass the USI validation
            process. </para>
        <para>Every Monday morning, all recently enrolled VET students who have not supplied you
            with their USI will be sent an automatic reminder email on how to complete this process
            and why it is important they do so. There is a customisable <link xlink:href="#emailTemplates">template</link> and <link xlink:href="#scripts">script</link> that
            runs this process which you can edit to meet your preferred business requirements. A
            student who doesn't complete this process or can not validate their USI will be flagged
            in onCourse for you to follow up. </para>
            <para>If you entered the USI manually, or the student entered it online, the USI will
            automatically be verified against the USI agencies system. In order for this process to
            work we will require a special authorisation key called an AUSkey from you and linked to
            your RTO. Please contact your onCourse account manager to assist you with this process.
            Unfortunately this system will not work for onCourse community edition users who don't
            have a support agreement with ish. In that case, you can still capture the USI within
            onCourse but you will not be able to take advantage of the online student self-service
            process or the automatic verification process.</para>
        </section>
    <section>
        <title>Student self-service</title>
        <para>On enrolment through the office or the web, onCourse will send an email enrolment
            confirmation to the student. If the course is VET flagged, the confirmation template
            will include some text directing the student to obtain and supply you with their
            USI.</para>
        <para>Another default script in onCourse can be enabled to send a reminder email to students
            every Monday at 9am until the class is complete or the USI is entered. You can modify
            these templates or alter the script which determines when and how often to send these
            emails. </para>
        <para>Note that students are only sent this email if they are enrolled in a VET flagged
            class, to avoid bothering your students engaging in non-VET training, however by default
            VET flagged courses without qualifications or units will also trigger this email as they
            are usually reported via AVETMISS for funding arrangements. You may wish to alter the
            scripts to only send the email when the course has a qualification record
            attached.</para>

        <para>Once the student gets the email requesting their USI, they will be able to click on a
            link which takes them directly to a page within the skillsOnCourse portal. They will not
            require a password and the link will be valid for 3 days from the email being sent. The
            URL is cryptographically signed so that they will not work after the expiry date and
            they will not be transferable between students. </para>
        <para>The skillsOnCourse portal page will explain the USI to the student and give them a
            convenient link to create or recover a USI if they don't have one or have forgotten it.
            This has been optimised so that it can be used on mobile and tablet devices. The student
            will be able to enter the USI and onCourse will handle the verification process
            automatically.</para>
        <para>The student will be asked to complete three steps: first supply their date of birth
            (if not supplied on enrolment) and USI, then the standard AVETMISS questions which are
            not mandatory, and then to supply any data for CMS mandatory fields that were not
            supplied on enrolment, like their address. If the USI agency reports back that the
            student's name is wrong (for example, they enrolled in onCourse with their maiden name
            but their USI is issued in their married name) then onCourse will give them the
            opportunity to fix this.</para>

        <para>All admin users will see the warnings if a student doesn't have a USI or verified USI,
            however they will be able to proceed to print for all certificates if they
            choose.</para>

        <para>All access roles have two optional levels of access - print certificate without
            verified USI (this means they student has supplied a USI that meets the checksum
            requirements, but for whatever reason it hasn't passed verification with the USI
            Registry System) and a higher level of permission, print certificate without USI.</para>
        <para>We do not recommend that you allow staff permission to print certificates without
            verified USIs.</para>
