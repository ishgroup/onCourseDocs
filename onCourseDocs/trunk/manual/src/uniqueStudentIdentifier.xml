        <title>What is the USI?</title>
        <para>On 1 January 2015 the Australian Commonwealth government introduced a Unique Student
            Identifier which will be issued to every student undertaking vocational training. Once a
            student has been issued a USI, they will supply this number to any RTO where they
            undertake training, be they short one day courses like First Aid, year long full
            Qualification programs or anything in between. The training they undertake will be
            reported back to government through mandatory AVETMISS reporting and a combined training
            transcript created for the student showing all training attempts and completions
            undertaken throughout their life. If the student declines to provide their USI, the RTO
            is not permitted to issue their Statement of Attainment or Qualification on completion
            of training.</para>
        <para>Eventually a USI will be issued to every child starting primary school and every
            student at university. The USI is similar to existing identity systems already in place
            in Australia: medicare number, tax file number, driver's license, etc. but it is not
            printed on an identity card and it is illegal for RTOs to print them on student cards or
            certificates.</para>
        <para>The USI can only be issued in an automated fashion by the USI agency in response to a
            request from a student who comes with certain identification papers. Medicare cards,
            driver's licenses, birth certificates and passports are probably the most common forms
            of identification which can be used. Students without any official identification papers
            can be issued a USI though a manual request process.</para>

        <title>The onCourse USI process</title>
        <para>Our primary goal is to make obtaining and verifying USIs the responsibility of the
            enrolling student to minimise the data entry and management effort required by your
            office staff. </para>
        <para>If a student enters their USI online, or you enter it manually in onCourse the USI
            will automatically be verified against the USI Agency system. In order for this process
            to work we will require a special authorisation key called an AUSkey that has been
            linked to your RTO. </para>
        <para>The verification system is not available to onCourse community edition users who don't
            have a support agreement with ish. You can still capture the USI within onCourse and
            report it for AVETMISS but you will not be able to take advantage of the online student
            self-service process or the automatic verification process. Community users can verify
            their student's USIs manually using the USI Agency RTO portal.</para>
        <section>
            <title>How onCourse automates the USI process</title>
            <para>We know that many organisations who use onCourse deliver a mix of accredited (VET)
                and non-accredited training, and that the USI requirements will not apply to their
                non-accredited students. We also know that some 75% of students who have ever
                enrolled via onCourse either have enrolled online or have provided an email address
                during the enrolment process, so can receive emails from us and access websites to
                complete web forms. </para>
            <para>First of all, when a student enrols in a course which is identified as a VET
                course, their enrolment confirmation will include some additional text explaining
                what a USI is and why they need to tell you theirs. This email directs them to a
                special onCourse portal page (no log in required) requesting they supply their USI
                or go through the process to create one. </para>
            <para>Most students will be going through the process of creating a new USI. Once they
                complete this part of the process, we will then take that new USI and verify it
                against their first name, last name and date of birth as supplied on enrolment. If
                the USI doesnâ€™t validate (possibly because the student used a dummy date of birth on
                enrolment, or a shortened version of their first name) then they will be prompted to
                update the incorrect data in onCourse to match their USI, so we can pass the USI
                validation process. </para>
            <para>Every Monday morning, all recently enrolled VET students who have not supplied you
                with their USI will be sent an automatic reminder email on how to complete this
                process and why it is important they do so. There is a customisable and that runs
                this process which you can edit to meet your preferred business requirements. A
                student who doesn't complete this process or can not validate their USI will be
                flagged in onCourse for you to follow up. </para>

        <para>On enrolment through the office or the web, onCourse will send an email enrolment
            confirmation to the student. If the course is VET flagged, the confirmation template
            will include some text directing the student to obtain and supply you with their
            USI.</para>
        <para>Another default script in onCourse can be enabled to send a reminder email to students
            every Monday at 9am until the class is complete or the USI is entered. You can modify
            these templates or alter the script which determines when and how often to send these
            emails. </para>
        <para>Note that students are only sent this email if they are enrolled in a VET flagged
            class, to avoid bothering your students engaging in non-VET training, however by default
            VET flagged courses without qualifications or units will also trigger this email as they
            are usually reported via AVETMISS for funding arrangements. You may wish to alter the
            scripts to only send the email when the course has a qualification record
            attached.</para>

        <para>The student will be asked to complete three steps: first supply their date of birth

            not mandatory, and then to supply any data for CMS mandatory fields that were not
            supplied on enrolment, like their address. If the USI agency reports back that the

                    <para>How do I make the USI validation process run in onCourse?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>When onCourse detects you have entered a USI in the USI field on the
                        Student VET tab, it will check that you have an RTO ID entered in your
                        general preferences, and a First Name, Last Name and Date of Birth entered
                        in the student record. If all these fields are complete, the USI Validation
                        process will run automatically in the background.</para>
                    <para>If it fails, and you need to change some of the data to make it try again,
                        make the change, click out of the field (use tab on your keyboard, or click
                        into any other field) and the process will run again. If you don't need to
                        change any data, just click in the USI field and click out and it will try
                        again. You can do this as many times as you like - the validation check is
                        quite fast, less than 3 seconds in most instances, and there is no limit to
                        the number of times you can try to validate a USI.</para>

                        can discard the contact instead of saving it onCourse after sufficiently
                        testing the verification process.</para>

                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>Commonly, students will enrol with the name they prefer to use e.g. Bob
                        rather than Robert, but their USI will be issued in their legal name. When
                        you try to verify the USI they supply against their name, an error will be
                        returned telling you that the first name (or last name, or date of birth)
                        doesn't match the USI you supplied. In that case, you can change the data in
                        onCourse and the verification process will automatically run again. </para>
                    <para>If the student uses the USI portal to supply you with their USI, then they
                        can correct their name spelling themselves. You might need to call the
                        student to get their correct name spelling if you are collecting and
                        verifying USIs via an office based process.</para>
                    <para>Of course, we have also had instances of students whose name is spelt
                        incorrectly on their ID and therefore the name linked to their USI has the
                        wrong spelling, or students who have enrolled using a married name, when the
                        ID they used to create their USI was in their maiden name. You'd need to
                        enter their name into onCourse as an exact match as their USI name to make
                        it validate, but you probably don't want to do this as then their
                        certificate will be issued in the wrong name too. For the time being, leave
                        it as an invalid USI.</para>
                    <para>In these instances you need to get the student to log into their own <link
                            xlink:href="https://portal.usi.gov.au/student">USI Agency Portal</link>
                        and make the change there, and advise you once this has been done. Then you
                        can try the validation process again, and it should pass with the right
                        spelling.</para>
