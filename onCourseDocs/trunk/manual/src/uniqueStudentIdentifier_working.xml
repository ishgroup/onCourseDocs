    <para>This section is only important for RTO's. If you are not an RTO, you don't need to worry
        about the USI or this section of the documentation.</para>
    <section xml:id="usi-onCourseProcess">
        <title>The onCourse USI process</title>
        <para>Our primary goal is to make obtaining and verifying USIs the responsibility of the
            enrolling student to minimise the data entry and management effort required by your
            office staff. </para>
        <para>If a student enters their USI online, or you enter it manually in onCourse the USI
            will automatically be verified against the USI Agency system. In order for this process
            to work you'll need to run through the USI Integration process, listed on our
            Integrations page here.</para>
        <para>The verification system is not available to onCourse community edition users who don't
            have a support agreement with ish. You can still capture the USI within onCourse and
            report it for AVETMISS but you will not be able to take advantage of the online student
            self-service process or the automatic verification process. Community users can verify
            their student's USIs manually using the USI Agency RTO portal.</para>
        <section>
            <title>How onCourse automates the USI process</title>
            <para>When a student enrols in a course which is identified as a VET course, their
                enrolment confirmation will include some additional text explaining what a USI is
                and why they need to tell you theirs. This email directs them to a special onCourse
                portal page (no log in required) requesting they supply their USI or go through the
                process to create one. </para>
            <para>Most students will be going through the process of creating a new USI. Once they
                complete this part of the process, we will then take that new USI and verify it
                against their first name, last name and date of birth as supplied on their
                enrolment. If the USI doesn't validate (possibly because the student used a dummy
                date of birth on enrolment, or a shortened version of their first name) then they
                will be prompted to update the incorrect data in onCourse to match their USI, so we
                can pass the USI validation process. </para>
            <para>Provided you have the 'send usi reminder' script enabled in the Automation >
                Scripts section, every Monday morning (this timing can be changed), all recently
                enrolled VET students who have not supplied you with their USI will be sent an
                automatic reminder email on how to complete this process and why it is important
                they do so. A student who doesn't complete this process or can not validate their
                USI will be flagged in onCourse for you to follow up. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title> What you need to do enable the USI validation service in onCourse </title>
            <para>You can enable the USI validation by following the steps laid out in the <link
                    xlink:href="externalIntegrations.html#externalintegrations-USI">USI section of
                    our external integrations chapter</link> of our documentation. There are a
                handful of steps that must be completed externally to the onCourse system before
                running the integration so ensure you follow each step closely before moving on to
                the next one.</para>

    <section xml:id="usi-selfService">
        <title>Student self-service</title>
        <para>On enrolment through the office or the web, onCourse will send an email enrolment
            confirmation to the student. If the course is VET flagged, the confirmation template
            will include some text directing the student to obtain and supply you with their
            USI.</para>
        <para>Another default script in onCourse can be enabled to send a reminder email to students
            every Monday at 9am until the class is complete or the USI is entered. You can modify
            these templates or alter the script which determines when and how often to send these
            emails. </para>
        <para>Note that students are only sent this email if they are enrolled in a VET flagged
            class, to avoid bothering your students engaging in non-VET training, however by default
            VET flagged courses without qualifications or units will also trigger this email as they
            are usually reported via AVETMISS for funding arrangements. You may wish to alter the
            scripts to only send the email when the course has a qualification record
            attached.</para>

        <para>Once the student gets the email requesting their USI, they will be able to click on a
            link which takes them directly to a page within the skillsOnCourse portal. They will not
            require a password and the link will be valid for 7 days from the email being sent. The
            URL is cryptographically signed so that they will not work after the expiry date and
            they will not be transferable between students.</para>
        <para>You can change the default 7 days expiry to any number of your choosing by editing
            your enrolment confirmation and USI reminder email templates.  </para>
        <para>The skillsOnCourse portal page will explain the USI to the student and give them a
            convenient link to create or recover a USI if they don't have one or have forgotten it.
            This has been optimised so that it can be used on mobile and tablet devices. The student
            will be able to enter the USI and onCourse will handle the verification process
            automatically. The student will be asked to complete three steps</para>
        <section>
            <title>Step 1: Personal Details</title>
        <para>The first step requests additional contact data not already captured on enrolment,
            that is mandatory for AVETMISS reporting or USI validation. No information they have
            previously supplied will be visible, only fields that are currently blank. This allows
            you, if desired, to collect minimal information during the online enrolment process and
            request the additional data be supplied post enrolment.</para>
        <para>In the example below, the student is required to complete some mandatory fields such
            as their street address and country of birth, plus some options contact details such as
            home phone numbers. Previously supplied contact details like email address and mobile
            phone number are not displayed.</para>

        <para>The second step requests the student complete the AVETMISS questions. Responses to
            these questions are not mandatory but may be important for verification of student
            access to various types of government funding, for example, accessing lower student fees
            for Smart &amp; Skilled funded programs.</para>
        <para>For each VET enrolment the student has in progress, they will be asked to complete a
                'reason for study' question. Some students may have this question once, for a single
                enrolment, where other students enrolled in multiple programs.</para>

        <title>Step 3: USI</title>
        <para>The third and last step requests the student supply their USI. If their date of birth
                was not supplied on enrolment, they will be asked to enter this also. If the student
                doesn't have, or know, their USI, they can click on the link to visit the USI Agency
                website to obtain or retrieve it.</para>

                    <para>Why are all my USIs failing to verify with the error message saying the

                <answer>
                    <para>For all the customers that <link xlink:href="https://forum.ish.com.au/discussion/276/preparing-your-rto-for-the-usi-implementation-in-2015#latest">followed the instructions we provided on our forum</link> about
                        creating an AUSKey, sending it to us to upload to your server and completing
                        the USI Agency Access request form, it seems the last step went pear shaped
                        for some and the AUSKey wasn't linked to your RTO Id, making the whole
                        automatic verification process fail.</para>

                <question>
                    <para>How do I make the USI validation process run in onCourse?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>When onCourse detects you have entered a USI in the USI field on the
                        Student VET tab, it will check that you have an RTO ID entered in your
                        general preferences, and a First Name, Last Name and Date of Birth entered
                        in the student record. If all these fields are complete, the USI Validation
                        process will run automatically in the background.</para>
                    <para>If it fails, and you need to change some of the data to make it try again,
                        make the change, click out of the field (use tab on your keyboard, or click
                        into any other field) and the process will run again. If you don't need to
                        change any data, just click in the USI field and click out and it will try
                        again. You can do this as many times as you like - the validation check is
                        quite fast, less than 3 seconds in most instances, and there is no limit to
                        the number of times you can try to validate a USI.</para>

                    <para>How can I test that my onCourse USI portal access is working as

                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>Go and <link xlink:href="http://usi.gov.au/create-your-USI/Pages/default.aspx">create
                            yourself a USI.</link> Then you can use your own details to create a new
                        student contact and test the USI verification. Try without a date of birth
                        or misspelled name to see the error responses you'll get in onCourse. You
                        can discard the contact instead of saving it onCourse after sufficiently
                        testing the verification process.</para>

                <question>
                    <para>What should I do when the student has created their USI in a name
                        different to the name they enrolled with?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>Commonly, students will enrol with the name they prefer to use e.g. Bob
                        rather than Robert, but their USI will be issued in their legal name. When
                        you try to verify the USI they supply against their name, an error will be
                        returned telling you that the first name (or last name, or date of birth)
                        doesn't match the USI you supplied. In that case, you can change the data in
                        onCourse and the verification process will automatically run again. </para>
                    <para>If the student uses the USI portal to supply you with their USI, then they
                        can correct their name spelling themselves. You might need to call the
                        student to get their correct name spelling if you are collecting and
                        verifying USIs via an office based process.</para>
                    <para>Of course, we have also had instances of students whose name is spelt
                        incorrectly on their ID and therefore the name linked to their USI has the
                        wrong spelling, or students who have enrolled using a married name, when the
                        ID they used to create their USI was in their maiden name. You'd need to
                        enter their name into onCourse as an exact match as their USI name to make
                        it validate, but you probably don't want to do this as then their
                        certificate will be issued in the wrong name too. For the time being, leave
                        it as an invalid USI.</para>
                    <para>In these instances you need to get the student to log into their own <link xlink:href="https://portal.usi.gov.au/student">USI Agency Portal</link>
                        and make the change there, and advise you once this has been done. Then you
                        can try the validation process again, and it should pass with the right
                        spelling.</para>

                <question>

                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>In the contact advanced search options, you can search for USI status =
                        not verified. You can then work through the list of returned to results to
                        check the error messages, contact the students and make the appropriate
                        changes. As you change the data, the verification process will run
                        again.</para>

                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>Using the class window, locate all your VET classes that are running
                        during 2015 and highlight them all. Use the cog wheel to find 'Enrolled
                        students' related to the highlighted classes.</para>
                    <para>In this new window of students, use the advanced find to search for USI
                        status = not set. Once you have this list of students, you can then manually
                        follow them up with phone calls or find their enrolments to send them the
                        USI reminder email.</para>
                    <para>To send the reminder email, select all the students and use the cogwheel
                        to find related enrolments. When the enrolment window opens, check the
                        filter options 'current active' and 'completed active' to remove any
                        cancelled or failed enrolments from the list. Then highlight all the
                        enrolments and from the cog wheel choose the option 'send emails from
                        template' and select the template called 'USI reminder email'.</para>

                <answer>
                    <para>You cannot merge two contacts with different verified USIs. If you attempt

                    <para>If only one of the contacts has a USI, then they can be merged, but their
                        First/Last Name and date of birth can't be changed during this

                <question>
                    <para>How do I validate a student who has only one name?</para>
                </question>
                <answer>
                    <para>You can put their 'one name' into both the first name and last name field
                        in onCourse and it will pass validation. For example, a student with a
                        single name like 'Madonna' will be entered as first name 'Madonna' and last
                        name 'Madonna'. Their certificate and other documentation issued from
                        onCourse will be in the single name 'Madonna', and the AVETMISS files will
                        export the expected 'Madonna, Madonna'. Some students are setting up their
                        USI with 'one name' because they misunderstand the question in the USI
                        portal. They think it means no middle name. If you have a student with a
                        name like 'Sally Smith' who has created their USI as one name, then you can
                        record her as First Name = Sally Smith and Last Name = Sally Smith so her
                        USI passes validation. </para>
