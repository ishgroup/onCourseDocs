        <title>What is onCourse cloud?</title>
        <para>onCourse cloud is a hosted version of onCourse which ish manage and maintain on your
            behalf. It is the same software and the same user interface as the locally installed
            application.</para>
        <para>The benefits of a cloud hosted solution include:</para>

                    software, with the data centre providing redundant links to the internet. All
                    networking equipment is full redundant and the database clustered across primary
                    and slave machines. If your primary office loses power or internet, remote
                    access to your onCourse server is still available from other sites.</para>

                    released. You do not need to engage your IT support company for any onCourse

                    software to install or maintain - you launch onCourse by going to a URL created
                    just for you. The software looks and behaves the same as the locally installed
                    version; although you launch the application from inside a browser, you aren't
                    restricted to the simplified user interface of a web application. The full
                    onCourse user experience is available complete with multiple windows, printing
                    and more.</para>

            <para>This demo is designed for people who wish to explore the onCourse user interface
                and features and give onCourse a test run to see if it is the right solution for use
                in their training organisation. Existing users who want to trial onCourse functions
                in a test database, provide training to new staff members provide or test the
                difference in performance between their locally hosted onCourse application and a
                cloud hosted onCourse are also welcome to access the demo.</para>
            <para>The demo contains sample data that is refreshed weekly, and which is shared
                between all current demo users. This demo database is not designed for users to
                enter real classes, students or enrolments. </para>

                is used at large and small companies by billions of people every day. It powers more
                websites than just about any other technology. However it has been used in the past
                for things called applets in your browser and this technology has had flaws which
                allowed malicious websites to do nasty things. onCourse is different: running the
                webstart version is exactly the same as running an application on your desktop
                directly and opens no new security holes. When you see advice about turning off Java
                in your browser that is related to these applets and not to the way onCourse runs or
                any other Java applications run.</para>
