        <title>What is onCourse cloud?</title>
        <para>onCourse cloud is a hosted version of the onCourse client and server application that
            ish manage and maintain on your behalf. It is the same software and the same user
            interface as the locally installed client and server onCourse application.</para>
        <para>The benefits of a cloud hosted solution include:</para>

                <para><emphasis role="bold">Hosting of your onCourse server in an enterprise grade
                        data centre.</emphasis> Your server will remain accessible throughout local
                    power failures and internet outages, as inside the data centre there are
                    redundant internet links and generator back up power. If your primary office
                    loses power or internet, remote access to your onCourse server is still
                    available from other sites.</para>

                    offsite backups and manage the software upgrade process for you when new
                    versions are released. You do not need to engage your IT support company for any
                    onCourse related issues or assistance as you may with a locally managed
                    version.</para>

                    No software to install or maintain - one URL for all your team, and Java takes
                    care of the rest. The software looks and behaves the same as the locally
                    installed version - you aren't restricted to operating inside an internet
                    browser window like some SaaS (Software as a Service) applications. </para>

                    your software when you agree for us to do so, and your data is not locked into
                    our solution - your database can be handed over to you for self management at

            <title>The onCourse Cloud Demo</title>
            <para>If you would like to trial the onCourse cloud hosted application you can find it

                    >https://www.ish.com.au/oncourse/cloud/demo/</link></para>
            <para>This demo is designed for people who wish to explore the onCourse user interface
                and features and give onCourse a test run to see if it is the right solution for use
                in their training organisation. Existing users who want to see the difference in
                performance between their locally hosted onCourse application and a cloud hosted
                onCourse, or who wish to test out new features before their next upgrade are also
                welcome to access the demo.</para>
            <para>The demo contains sample data that is refreshed weekly, and which is shared
                between all current demo users. This demo database is not designed for users to
                enter real classes, students or enrolments. </para>
            <para>The onCourse Demo has a pre-filled user name and password. Just click 'login' to
