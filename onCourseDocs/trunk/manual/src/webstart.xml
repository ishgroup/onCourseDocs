                    and slave machines. If your primary office loses power or internet, remote

                    by going to a URL created just for you. The software looks and behaves the same
                    as the locally installed version; although you launch the application from
                    inside a browser, you aren't restricted to the simplified user interface of a
                    web application. The full onCourse user experience is available complete with

                websites than just about any other technology. However it has been used in the past
                for things called applets in your browser and this technology has had flaws which
                allowed malicious websites to do nasty things. onCourse is different: running the
                webstart version is exactly the same as running an application on your desktop
                directly and opens no new security holes. When you see advice about turning off Java
                in your browser that is related to these applets and not to the way onCourse runs or
                any other Java applications run.</para>
