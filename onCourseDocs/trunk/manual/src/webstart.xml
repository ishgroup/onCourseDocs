        <title>What is onCourse cloud?</title>
        <para>onCourse cloud is a hosted version of onCourse which
            ish manage and maintain on your behalf. It is the same software and the same user
            interface as the locally installed application.</para>
        <para>The benefits of a cloud hosted solution include:</para>

                    data centre providing redundant links to the internet. All networking equipment is full redundant and the database clustered across primary and slave machines. If your primary office
                    loses power or internet, remote access to your onCourse server is still
                    available from other sites.</para>

                    offsite backups and manage the upgrade process for you when new
                    versions are released. You do not need to engage your IT support company for any
                    onCourse related issues or assistance as you may with a locally managed
                    version.</para>

                <para><emphasis role="bold">Simplified user application access.</emphasis>
                    No software to install or maintain - you launch onCourse by going to a URL created
                    just for you. The software looks and behaves the same as the locally
                    installed version; although you launch the application from inside a browser, you aren't restricted to the simplified user interface of a web application. The full onCourse user
                    experience is available complete with multiple windows, printing and more.</para>

                <para><emphasis role="bold">No need to update and install new client software when
                        your server is upgraded. </emphasis>New versions of the onCourse client
                    software are applied automatically when your staff log in.</para>

                    machines. Access is to onCourse is secure from any venue and encrypted with                  SSL at the same level of encryption as banking systems.</para>

                    your software when you are ready, and your data is not locked into
                    our solution - your database can be handed over to you for self management at

            <title>The onCourse Cloud Demo</title>
            <para>If you would like to trial the onCourse cloud hosted application you can find it

                    >https://www.ish.com.au/oncourse/cloud/demo/</link></para>
            <para>This demo is designed for people who wish to explore the onCourse user interface
                and features and give onCourse a test run to see if it is the right solution for use
                in their training organisation. Existing users who want to see the difference in
                performance between their locally hosted onCourse application and a cloud hosted
                onCourse, or who wish to test out new features before their next upgrade are also
                welcome to access the demo.</para>
            <para>The demo contains sample data that is refreshed weekly, and which is shared
                between all current demo users. This demo database is not designed for users to
                enter real classes, students or enrolments. </para>
            <para>The onCourse Demo has a pre-filled user name and password. Just click 'login' to
