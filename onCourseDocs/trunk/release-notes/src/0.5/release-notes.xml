      <title>Printing</title>
      <para>This very flexible printing structure allows printing to pdf, Excel and paper. The Excel
        output is a early form of data export for onCourse (further options will be made available
        in the future). Because the reporting templates are XML based, it is possible for users to
        customise existing reports or created completely new reports by simply adding the
        appropriate XML template files to the report setup.</para>

          <para>Programmer errors (in the unlikely event that one slips through!) now result in a
            special window appearing to the end user with debug information and a button which
            allows the user to automatically send that report back to ish. No confidential
            information is sent and all information sent to ish may be viewed before sending. This
            has proved very useful in our beta testing process, so we decided to keep this in the
            final release, just in case.</para>
