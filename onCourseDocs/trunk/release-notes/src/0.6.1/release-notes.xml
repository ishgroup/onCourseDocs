          <para>Waiting lists are now implemented. This is for students you cannot offer a place to
            immediately but you want to keep track of their needs. We still need to hook this into
            the web site, but for now we have implemented the onCourse side of this.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>When the server starts up for the first time, you can now choose to create a new
            data file with sample data included. This makes it easier to people to begin testing
            onCourse.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Speed improvements. We have threaded many parts of the user interface drawing code
            so now much of it happens in parallel. This means that windows will now open much more
            quickly and the application as a whole is more responsive to mouse clicks and key
            presses.</para>

    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Financial transaction report (a list of transactions suitable for opening in
            Excel)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Better clarity in creating new students in the ‘clairvoyance’ data entry within
            Quick Enrol. There is now a “create new…” option at the bottom of the list of student
            choices.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Multiple enrolments may now be refunded in one go rather than one at a time as
            before</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Improved progress bars for tasks which take a long time (eg. printing, duplicating
            classes, etc). Yes, it is only cosmetic, but it looks nice.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Duplicating courses now gives better and clearer options to move the classes forward
            a certain number of days, along with all included sessions.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>More drag and drop events throughout the application, allowing you to drag items
            from a list window (eg. a student or class) onto another window (eg. the Quick Enrol
            window)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Student message field extended from 50 characters to 500.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Discount rounding (eg. to nearest dollar, 10 cents or 50 cents) is now
            possible.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Outcome list now shows the name of non-VET courses so that a user can quickly see
            which course the outcome refers to when there is no AVTEMISS module linked.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Dates can now be entered in the format 010207 or 01022007, both of which mean
            01-02-2007.</para>

    <title>Fixes</title>
    <para>Many GUI quirks have been cleaned up now, particular in clairvoyance (type-ahead).</para>
    <para>Windows users were not able to print if they did not have write permissions to the
      location where the onCourse application was located. We now save temporary print files to a
      better location.</para>
    <para>The application did not prevent you from over-enrolling a class. It now still allows you
      to do so, but gives you a warning. We will be looking at whether we want to completely prevent
      this, or allow users to proceed with a warning.</para>
