    <para>Over the past month, we've been working on a number of issues that were present in our 1.0
      release. We strongly recommend that people update both server and client to 1.0.1 to enjoy the
      improvements.</para>

    <title>Major features</title>
    <para>When using QE to enrol a student in a class that had only a single place left, there was a
      bug that would not allow that last place to be enrolled. This has been resolved and onCourse
      now correctly allows the last place to be filled.</para>
    <para>The quick search in the contacts list now allows correctly searching for student first
      names by either using either "Smith, James" or "James Smith" as originally intended. </para>
    <para>A number of individual reports did not print correctly in 1.0. These now print
      correctly.</para>
