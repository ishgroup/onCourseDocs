    <title>Important changes</title>
    <para>Because this is a major update, it is very important that you take a backup before
      performing this upgrade. It will then take up to 10 minutes (on a slow server) to upgrade your
      data once you start the new onCourse server before you are able to log in again.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Access control</title>
      <para>Want to lock certain users out of parts of onCourse? Now you can control users’ rights
        to almost every part of the application, down to ‘view’, ‘edit’, ‘create’, ‘delete’ and
        ‘print’ right levels. For SMS and email, you can even control which users can send up to 50
        messages and which can blast your entire customer base with many more..</para>
      <para>Access control sounds simple to describe, but it has been a big effort to implement and
        test throughout the whole application.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Quick find in lists</title>
      <para>It has always been possible to search for records in classes, tutors, courses, rooms,
        and in fact in any list view within onCourse. That search functionality is still there and
        even improved, but there is now a quick way to search directly in the list view, select
        tagged items and restore saved searches.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Quicker ways to view related records</title>
      <para>We’ve added our goto icon (<inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata
              fileref="images/link-rollover.png"
              depth="9" width="14"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>) in more places – as usual clicking on this will open up the related
        record in a new window.</para>
      <para>As an example, in the following image, if you click on on the icon(<inlinemediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata
              fileref="images/link-rollover.png"
              depth="9" width="14"/>
          </imageobject>
        </inlinemediaobject>), this will open the student record in a new window.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Tagging and Untagging more than one record at once</title>
      <para>One of the features that was requested was a means to manage tags in bulk, we’ve
        included this feature now in our latest release.</para>
      <para>Assuming that you’ve already created some tags, highlight the records that you’d like to
        tag and right click the tag on the left. This should give you the option to either add the
        tag to the highlighted records or remove the tag from the highlighted records.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Class budgets</title>
      <para>Each class can be allocated a set of costs: fixed, per session, per hour or per
        enrolment. This allows you to define costs such as room rental per hour, materials costs per
        student and so on. You can also enter your target enrolments, enter funding arrangements
        (eg. government contributions) calculate minimum break-even, report on target vs actuals
        over any period and produce budgets.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>External backend database choices</title>
      <para>MySQL, Microsoft SQL and Oracle are now additional choices for backend database in
        addition to the existing built-in Derby engine. These new choices allow the system to scale
        effectively to enterprise level customers, allow for clustered databases and improve server
        speed, reporting and backup options.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>AQTF 2007 Competency Completion Quality Indicator export</title>
      <para>A new AQTF requirement has been imposed on all RTOs in Australia. onCourse is the first
        enrolment package to support this new export and does it without requiring any additional
        work from you.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Flexible outcome creation</title>
      <para>99% of the time, an accredited course is built in advance with a qualification and the
        appropriate units of competency/modules linked. But sometimes, the actual units taught can
        vary only after the class has started when a tutor makes decisions based on the competencies
        of the class. English as a Second Language (eg. CSWE) is often in this category. In this
        case onCourse now allows for this flexibility, giving you the option to create outcomes
        individually per enrolment. For example, some students may complete one outcome, while
        others may engage with, and complete more.</para>
      <para>For managing various funding groups within the one class, such as state funded, AMEP
        funded and overseas full fee paying students, it is now also possible to modify the National
        Funding Source field per enrolment. It will automatically be set to the default of the
        class, but can be overridden as needed. </para>
      <para>Start and end date and delivery mode can also be modified on a per enrolment basis, so
        RPL outcomes can be assigned and the enrolment can stay with the rest of the class
        group.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Nominal hours, classroom hours and Student Contact Hours</title>
      <para>On the class window, there is a new tab called VET, which contains fields that are
        useful for RTOs and relate to AVETMISS and other delivery statistics. The three AVETMISS
        specific fields ‘Delivery mode’, ‘funding source’ and ‘DET booking ID’ have moved to this
        tab, from the General tab. Additional fields regarding hours have been added.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Qualification Hours</emphasis> – These are the nominal hours set
        by NCVER for the qualification. Often, this field is left blank, which is acceptable for
        AVETMISS.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Student Contact Hours</emphasis> – This field multiplies the
        number of students enrolled by the number of reportable hours. SCHs are often used by
        funding bodies to measure delivery.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Classroom Hours</emphasis> – The total hours you have defined as
        scheduled activity by setting sessions or by defining the minutes per sessions and number of
        sessions on the General tab. This is not reported as part of AVETMISS – it is for your
        information only.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Nominal Hours</emphasis> – The total nominal hours of the units of
        competency assigned to the course. While the nominal hours are usually set by NCVER, you can
        override them or add them where they are missing in Module record.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Reportable Hours</emphasis> – These are the hours that will be
        reported against each enrolment in the NAT00120 file. They default to the nominal hours of
        the course. If there are no nominal hours as set by the module, i.e. in a non-VET course,
        the nominal and reportable hours will default to the classroom hours. You can override the
        reportable hours field to the classroom hours or any other number that you wish to export in
        it’s place. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Custom Fields for Contacts</title>
      <para>You can create custom fields for contacts which will be searchable. This allows you to
        create fields for, and record information that is particular to your business. Some examples
        of how this field may be used are payroll numbers, licence numbers, student numbers that
        stay with the student between training organisations and date of initial contact. You can
        add as many additional fields as you need to contact.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Relationships for Contacts</title>
      <para>You can define how contacts relate to each other, such as siblings, spouse and parents
        and make contacts employees of companies. This is especially useful for tutors who work as
        contractors and may have separate business and personal contact details.</para>
