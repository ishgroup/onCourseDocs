      <title>Quick Enrol new user interface</title>
      <para>Quick Enrol now allows you to work between two panes, adding contacts, enrolments and
        charges to the left, while setting the details to the right. This format makes for easier
        single-screen editing of large windows, and a better visual overview of the information you
        have collected for the enrolment.</para>
      <para>Some additional enhancements to Quick Enrol that this redesign has allowed
        include:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Ability to edit student contact details without opening additional windows</para>

          <para>Ability to choose from current and past classes for enrolment</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Automatic display of course list includes current classes that are full or cancelled
            so when a student requests a class that is unavailable, you have the information at your
            fingertips to provide an alternative class.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>More detail shown in class summary, including number of sessions, number of
            enrolments, vacancies, tutor, fee and start date.</para>

            friends enrolling together in the same two classes</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Visual clues and more use of icons e.g. email and postal settings for confirmations,

      </itemizedlist>
        </section>
    <section>
      <title>Banking for Multiple Sites</title>
      <para>If your college operates multiple administrative sites where staff collect and bank cash
        and cheques, onCourse now includes a facility to nominate sites as administrative centres
        and set the default administrative centre for each onCourse user account. If users move
        between sites, they can change their centre once they log in.</para>
      <para>Banking reports generated, and income considered ‘banked’ will then be dependent on the
        location of the user, ensuring that each administrative site retains full control over the
        cash &amp; cheque collection it manages. A sexy new banking report (in colour) is now
        available.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>

    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Concessions</title>
      <para>Any type of concession card may now be tracked in onCourse. If you choose to accept a
        Senior’s Card for example, you can add that card type in preferences and then enter the card
        details against each student. If you allow a discount to be given against that card, then
        the student is able to access that concession online through web enrolments as well as over
        the phone. You can also track the expiry date for the card as well as the card number for
        verification purposes.</para>
    </section>

        <title>Customised headers</title>
        <para>Every college can create an own print header using a new text area in the General
          preferences under the “Print” tab. The textarea allows you to enter maximum 6 lines with
          up to 82 characters per line to enforce that everything fits into the report title.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Custom Logo</title>
        <para>It is now possible to choose any logo you wish for the printed reports. Go to File ->
          Preferences -> General -> tab Printing. There you see all available reports and on the top
          of that a button “Set print header logo”. Clicking on that opens a dialog which displays
          the current logo and where you can import any image (smaller that 2MB).</para>
        <para>The image can have any height or width, it is adjusted to the correct size on the
          report. </para>

      <title>AVETMISS</title>
      <para>A host of small improvements has been made to AVETMISS exporting. A new user interface
        allows you to set 81 as the outcome status for all unset outcomes. This is very useful where
        99% of your outcomes are success and you only need to set your non-81 outcome results. Also
        a bunch of improvements have been made to work around quirks in the Oliv tests, for instance
        where it doesn’t understand web based delivery sites not having a postcode, so we export
        something sensible to tame the AVETMISS beast.</para>
