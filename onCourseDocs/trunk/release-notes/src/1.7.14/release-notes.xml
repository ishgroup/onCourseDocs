        <title>Victorian AVETMISS customisation</title>
        <para>Although onCourse has for a long time exported to the national AVTEMISS standard, most
          states define a range of exceptions to the standard (which means it really isn’t much of a
          standard at all!). For the majority of users the Victorian export will work fine, but
          there are some types of colleges which could produce non-compliant data. We are working on
          this as an ongoing project. For NSW, Tasmania and Queensland users we believe that the
          exceptions to the AVETMISS standard are all accounted for.</para>
