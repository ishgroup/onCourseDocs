    <title>Important changes</title>
    <para>In this release we've removed the left sidebar part of search queries from the search
    box. That means that tags, core filters and saved searches will no longer appear as part of the
    search expression.</para>
    <para>Feedback was that this was too complicated for most people and the extra functionality was
    not really necessary.</para>
    <para>At the same time we've been able to make searches considerable faster in cases that you've
    ticked lots of tags in the sidebar.</para>
