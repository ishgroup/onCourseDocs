    <section>
      <title>Memberships and Discounts</title>
      <para>Memberships are a new type of product which is available to sell to customers.
        Memberships can be created within onCourse for individuals or groups or related contacts,
        such as employees of a company. A membership can have one or more discounts attached,
        allowing special class prices to be made available to membership holders. Memberships can
        expire a set period of days after their purchase. This is the first of many products we plan
        on implementing within onCourse over the coming versions. The Promotional Code and
        Concessions windows have now been merged into a single window called Discounts.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Dashboard Update</title>
      <para>The onCourse dashboard has been redesigned to represent the main areas of business and
        process of our users. The new tabbed approach allows us to offer more options to users to
        access onCourse functions. The dashboard is now grouped into "Course Setup", "Customer
        Service", "Accounts" and "Marketing" and additional explanation text is provided to assist
        new users in navigating their way through the software.</para>

      <title>Timetable and Resource Availability</title>
      <para>The major revision of the class window layout includes significant improvements to the
        timetabling and scheduling functions in onCourse. Proposed sessions allow you to see at a
        glance any scheduling conflicts before you finalise a classes sessions. New unavailability
        tools for tutors, rooms, sites and the college allow you to create entries when these
        resources are not available for class bookings due to outside bookings, public holidays or
        for any other reason. New timetable views and editing options allow you to see eight weeks
        at a glance and edit all, or a single session of a class. The class window list now shows a
        session count. Creating timetabled sessions are now essential for a class to have a start
        and end date.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Attendance and CRICOS</title>
      <para>Attendance marking for scheduled sessions is available for both tutors and students.
        Attendance can be marked from within the onCourse application or via the web tutor portal.
        Records of student absence and partial attendance can be recorded, and percentage of
        attendance is calculated. Of particular benefit to CRICOS colleges, students with less than
        80% and less than 70% attendance are flagged within the system for follow up. Additional
        recording fields for student VISA and OSHC have been added to the student AVETMISS tab for
        use with CRICOS students.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Tutor Pay Rates</title>
      <para>Found under File -> Preferences -> Tutor Role. For each tutor role you create, you can
        add multiple pay rates. When a tutor is assigned to the class, the default pay rate of their
        tutor type will apply via the budget, assisting you in calculating the direct costs of
        running the class. This function can also be used to calculate 'per enrolment payments' to
        other staff members, like the class coordinator or an external contractor. Tutor attendance
        at scheduled sessions can be confirmed and pay cards created for your chosen pay periods,
        calculating the total gross income due to the tutor, ready to submit to your payroll
        department.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Improvements to Class Window</title>
      <para>The layout of the class window has changed to better reflect the workflow of setting up
        classes for enrolment and managing class viability. The general tab now shows summary
        information of the class, which is set in other tabs in the record making it easier for
        users to see at a glance the status of the class. In combination with the improvements to
        the budget feature, this summary will calculate the class viability based on the number of
        current and projected enrolments from the class costs you have assigned. The class fee (how
        much the student has to pay on enrolment) has moved to the budget tab, to facilitate future
        development allowing deposit fees, charges for additional class resources like textbooks or
        catering, and fees payable by other contacts, like employers, to be added in future
        versions.</para>
