    <para>This is a minor bug fix release which has only one change in it. We upgraded the jetty
      server library to 7.6.3 to order to avoid some issues with serving SSL connections. The
      problem manifested very rarely and if you arenâ€™t having trouble with the server stopping
      unexpectedly, then you will get no benefit from this release.</para>
