      <para>Advanced search improvements are still being worked on for the next update. Known issues
        include unexpected results when searching for ‘not tagged with’ or ‘tagged with (or parent
        of this tag)’ results in advanced find.</para>

        <para>Some problems were introduced in 2.1.2 which prevented some parts of the onCourse Web
          from being updated after changes in onCourse. This is now fixed.</para>

        <para>In an attempt to fix the advanced search on tags, 2.1.3 broke search on subject tags
          in the class list view. This is now fixed. Searching on more than one tag at once in the
          advanced search still has problems and the fix is targeted for 2.1.5 in the next few
          weeks. This issue has proven more complex than we hoped.</para>
