      <para><emphasis role="bold">Symptom:</emphasis> when sending large numbers of emails in one
        go, multiple copies could be delivered to the recipients. The threshold for what constitutes
        a ‘large number of emails’ will differ depending on the speed of your onCourse Server
        hardware and the speed of your mail server. We expect this to vary between 25 (remote slow
        mail server) and 2000 (local good quality mail server).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Details:</emphasis> A mail processing thread wakes up every minute
        to deliver emails created within the onCourse system. This queuing mechanism was created so
        that your onCourse server could be shut down, your mail server be offline or your internet
        connection down, and when services are restored all queued emails are sent without missing
        any emails.</para>
      <para>However, if the number of emails to be sent was large, the sending of those emails would
        not complete within one minute and a second thread would wake up to start sending emails to
        the queue. In itself this would not be a problem since the first thread would be marking
        emails as ‘delivered’ and saving that status to the database as soon as each email is sent.
        However the first thread already had loaded the list of emails into memory, so when the
        second thread started to pass the first one with regard to which record it was trying to
        send (as it would since it had less work to do) it would then started sending emails that
        the first thread would shortly also deliver to. This would then deliver duplicates to some
        of the recipients in the original list. Since email sending wakes up for delivery once a
        minute, the problem would only occur if email delivery took more than one minute. If email
        delivery continued into the third minute, then some users might get 1 email, others 2 and
        others 3.</para>
      <para>We have corrected this problem in two ways: </para>
      <para> 1. only one email sending thread is created at a time, even if it takes a long time to
        finish running. This in itself is sufficient to fix the problem.</para>
      <para> 2. each email to be sent is refetched (in batches of 25) before sending, to recheck
        that its status hasn’t already changed to sent. This will limit the problem to at most 25
        emails which will usually be sent within one minute. This was done to ensure that even if
        some future issue allows multiple threads to run at once we have another way to limit the
        problem.</para>

          versions 2.1 or higher.</emphasis></para>
