    <para>This is a very minor release which corrects a race condition between two threads when
      uploading attendance records to an onCourse website. This could result in certain records not
      being updated because they were ‘stuck behind’ the attendance. For users without an onCourse
      website, this upgrade will not make any difference.</para>
    <para>Work is ongoing on our 2.1.6 release which includes fixes for a wider range of issues,
      including advanced search on multiple tags.</para>
