    <title>Major features</title>
    <section>
      <title>Dashboard</title>
      <para>The onCourse dashboard has been implemented. This shows a graphical representation of
        recent enrolment and financial activity for an 'at a glance' view of your college's business
        activities</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Budget</title>
      <para>New layout has been implemented for the class budget tab to provide more and clearer
        information about actual and budgeted income and expenses. In particular a whole new
        mechanism has been implemented to estimate the dollar value of discounts given away. The
        fields for enrolment minimum, maximum and projected which were previously located on the
        general tab, have been moved to the budget tab to improve the layout and now show for all
        budgeted items a comparison between the income and expenses for maximum, projected and
        actual columns.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>AVETMISS</title>
      <para>AVETMISS export options have been updated to meet the AVETMISS 6.1 requirements
        including the addition of the Specific Program Identifier field in the NAT00120 and the
        capacity to automatically set outcome status 90 for all outcomes not yet set during the
        export process</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Deferred income.</title>
      <para>Rather than posting income to the general ledger at the time of enrolment, fees are
        posted to a "pre-paid fees" liability account in the onCourse GL. This is then journalled
        over to income as the class delivery occurs, giving you a much better view of actual income
        measured against delivery. This is particularly significant when you take enrolments in
        batches (eg at the start of term) and delivery stretches out over several months.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Minimum requirements</title>
      <para>onCourse 3.0 increases some of the minimum requirements.</para>
