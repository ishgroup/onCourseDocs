    <para>Ensure that students enrolled in module only enrolments are reported as enrolling and
      working towards a qualification (note for non QLD users, the opposite applies in other states
      &emdash; module only enrolments report with no links to a parent qualification, as the student has
      not indicated their intent to enrol in, and complete, a full qualification).</para>
    <para>Note that this does not comply with Queensland Department of Educationâ€™s own published
      guidelines, however they insist on this reporting change.</para>
