    <section>
      <title>CorporatePass</title>
      <para>The CorporatePass feature is designed to be used for training which is paid for by the
        student’s company or the client’s agency, to allow the student to enrol online without
        payment, and the invoice to be sent to the nominated company representative for payment. </para>
      <para>The CorporatePass feature is only available to users with an onCourse enrolment website
        as they are only used during the online enrolment process. As always, users of the
        standalone onCourse application can create, and issue, unpaid invoices to third party payers
        at any time.</para>
      <para>For more information, see the new CorporatePass chapter in the user handbook</para>

      <title>Printing backgrounds</title>
      <para>Although you have always been able to customise the reports in onCourse, you are now
        able to add your own customisations with greater ease. Just create a PDF file with your
        letterhead or any other design which will appear behind the reports. When you print a report
        you are then given an option to upload that PDF and make it a background for your printed
        report. Once you have done this, the background underlay is available for all users of your
        onCourse system for any report.</para>
      <para>This function is especially useful for colleges who wish to create custom Certificates.
        Using the standard onCourse template and text, you can print a certificate that also
        includes your logos, college details, borders and images, and NRT and other AQF logos on the
        background.</para>
      <para>You can even create a multiple page PDF. The first page will appear behind the first
        page of your report and the second page will appear behind all subsequent pages. onCourse
        remembers the last background you used for each type of report and auto selects it next time
        you print the report.</para>
      <para>For more information on creating and managing print backgrounds, refer to the updated Reports
          chapter in the user handbook</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic"> A standard onCourse Qualification certificate printed with out
          a background (left) and with a background applied (right) </emphasis></para>

    <section>
      <title>Course relations</title>
      <para>Courses can now be linked to other courses. This allows you to create relationships
        between courses such as between French level 1 and French level 2; or perhaps to lead them
        from “MYOB for beginners” to “Strategies for small businesses”. On the website these
        relations will be shown to students as suggestions for other courses they may be interested
        in. This is a simple marketing device to encourage students to explore the full breadth of
        what you have to offer even if these choices are in other subject categories on your
        website.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic"> Related courses can be added from the Courses > Marketing tab
          (this tab was previously named Web) </emphasis></para>

    <section>
      <title>USI and AVETMISS 7</title>
      <para>onCourse includes the new USI (Unique Student Identifier) field and capacity to export
        to the AVETMISS 7 version of the standard, in preparation for reporting requirements which
        will come into place in January 2014. We export to the AVETMISS 7 national standard, plus
        the South Australia modified standard. For other states, we’ve taken a guess as to what they
        want (and it may be almost right) however we await formal documentation from each state for
        their interpretation of the non-standard standard. <link xlink:href="http://xkcd.com/927"
          >This summarises</link> the current state of affairs.</para>
      <para>Both the 6.1 and 7.0 AVETMISS reporting standards are currently available within
        onCourse due to transitional reporting requirements.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">The USI field is located on the student contact record AVETMISS
          tab. Data entered into this field will only export if AVETMISS 7.0 is chosen as the export
          standard </emphasis></para>

      <title>Performance</title>
      <para>We have spent significant effort in this release to improve network performance and
        reduce memory usage. This will impact the entire application, but in particular the class
        edit screen has been a focus of our efforts. You may not notice any difference if you were
        on a fast local network, but remote connections should see significant improvement. In some
        cases on a very slow link we observed open the class edit view improve from 30 seconds to 5
        seconds.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Tagging</title>
      <para>Tag groups can now no longer be available to both courses and classes at the same time.
        This has caused quite a lot of confusion for our users over the years, and the use-case for
        such a feature is so narrow that we figure it is time to restrict this option to what people
        mostly want to achieve. Tagging classes should be a pretty rare thing anyway, and if you
        have a tag group linked to both courses and classes, the class tags will be deleted by this
        upgrade. In 99.99% of cases that’s what you were probably trying to do. If not, contact us
        before you run this upgrade. </para>
