      <title>Document management</title>
      <para>Document Management in onCourse has just become bigger and better. With the recently
        launched document delivery system in the onCourse portal, you now have the opportunity to
        easily provide resources to tutors and students via their portal login. Remember, the
        skillsOnCourse portal is available to all onCourse licensed users, even if you don’t have an
        onCourse website.</para>
      <para>Documents can also now be attached directly to enrolments, so completed student
        assessment tasks can be stored in an easy to find way in onCourse. Public, private, tutor
        only and tutor and student resources can be centrally managed and controlled for greater
        transparency and compliance with AQTF and NVR document record keeping standards. </para>
      <para>For documents like policies and procedures, assessment tasks and learning resources, you
        can choose to lock previous class instances to previous versions, while new classes will
        have access to more recent versions. With versioning, historic documents can never be
        deleted, even in error. Compliance is now made even easier with a complete audit trail
        always available.</para>
      <para>Users of onCourse with a support contract have been given cloud storage for their
        documents. This gives you:</para>

      <title>Portal user switching</title>
      <para>For employers, HR managers, client managers or even parents who manage a group of
        students attending training at your college, you can now assign portal switching permissions
        based on contact relationships in onCourse. This allows approved users to login to the
        SkillsOnCourse portal and then switch the view to see the portal records for any of their
        related contacts.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Capture Parent/Guardian contact details for under 18’s during online enrolment</title>
      <para>The online enrolment process will now detect any enrolling student under 18 years of
        age, and request that emergency contact details are provided for their parent or guardian.
        This will create a new contact record in onCourse with a fixed relationship to the student.
        By default, the Parent/Guardian will be set as the payer for the enrolment and therefore be
        sent the invoice, but this can be switched back to the student or another contact at
        payment.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Add custom fields to online enrolment</title>
      <para>Custom fields that have been added to onCourse contact records can now be added to the
        online enrolment process. In the onCourse CMS you will see your custom fields and can make
        them shown, hidden or mandatory for enrolling students. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Define age restrictions for enrolment in a class</title>
      <para>All classes in onCourse now have two new fields to allow you define a minimum and/or a
        maximum age of enrolment. Some classes may be set to have, for example, a minimum age of 16
        for enrolment while classes for children may have an age range set i.e. 6 to 9 years. For
        these rules to be enforced in the online enrolment process, you must have set the date of
        birth field as mandatory in the CMS settings. </para>
      <para>If you do not wish to set varying enrolment age permissions at the class level, you
        still have the ability to set a global age minimum for enrolment in the CMS. If you choose
        to set an age restriction at the class level, this will override the CMS global preference
        for minimum enrolment age for that class only. For example, you could have your CMS global
        age minimum set to 18, and then have some specific children’s classes with lower minimum
        ages. Note there is no global preference for minimum age for taking enrolments through the
        office &emdash; the CMS setting only applies for student enrolling online.</para>

      </para>
      <para>Students who have previously provided a date of birth that doesn’t meet the class
        enrolment rules can not change their age during the online enrolment process and will be
        prompted to contact the college to complete the enrolment process.</para>
      <para>During an office based enrolment, users will be prompted to complete the date of birth
        fields for customers enrolling in an age restricted class, and will also be notified of (and
        have the opportunity to correct) the date of birth of a student enrolling who is outside the
        set age range.</para>

            see about what content will be delivered in the session, or any special resources they
            should bring. Public notes will be shown in the timetable on the class page on the
            website, and in the student’s portal. Private notes is for internal notes about
            resourcing or room configuration that may be required to deliver the session and is not
            publicly visible on the website, but printable in timetable reports.</para>

          <para>Improvements in AVETMISS 7 to the auto setting of outcomes after the reporting
            period to 70. Previously, outcomes with an end date after the export end date were
            automatically set to 70. Now, outcomes with an end date in the year after the year of
            the export end date are set to 70. This means that for partial year data exports, only
            outcomes ending in the following calendar year will be set to 70. Where unset outcomes
            ending in the export range calendar year will be exported as 00, 81 or 90 depending
            which override outcome is chosen in the export window.</para>
