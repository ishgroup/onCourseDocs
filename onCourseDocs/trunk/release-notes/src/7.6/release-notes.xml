    <title>Important changes</title>
    <para>The "timetables" view has been removed from this release. This view was not well optimised for speed and the way it displayed all sessions from all classes in one big view wasn't terribly useful. The poor performance of this view was giving new users a bad impression, where there are better ways to show a timetable from site, room, class, course, student or tutor views. We'll restore this view once we have a more useful interface designed.</para>

      <title>User defined payment types</title>
      <para>
        onCourse now allows you to add your own type of payment methods, for example, VET FEE HELP, B-Pay or PayPal. You can also edit any existing payment type that is included in onCourse, or remove a payment type that you don't allow at your organisation e.g. cheque, provided you have never taken any payments by that method.

      <title>Banking window restructure</title>
      <para>
        The new banking window allows you to see all payment in and out transactions grouped together on their banking date, including those banked automatically such as credit card and EFTPOS. This will assist with reconciliation process, as well as allow you to easily locate and edit the banking dates of transactions such as EFT/direct deposit. To access this window from the top menu by clicking on Financial -> Banking. You can manually bank money from this window by clicking on the '+' icon inside the banking list view. Alternatively, the 'Deposit banking' window can still be accessed in the 'Accounts' tab of the dashboard.

      <title>Transfer enrolment wizard</title>
        <para>
        A transfer enrolment process has been added to the enrolment window cog wheel function. This is similar to the 'cancel enrolment' process with the addition of opening Quick Enrol at the end of the process, pre loaded with the student, payer and course details, allowing you to make a speedy transfer of the student to another class.
