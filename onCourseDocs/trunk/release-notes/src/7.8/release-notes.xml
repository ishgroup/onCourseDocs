      <title>Custom field drop down boxes for onCourse and the web</title>
      <para>Custom fields for contact records can now be made into drop down selections of choices
        for use inside both the onCourse application and on your onCourse enrolment website. This
        feature allows you to define a list of choices inside the custom field settings, separating
        each item with a ; e.g. Radio; TV; Internet; *</para>
      <para>If you include an asterisk (*) in the list as per the example above, then your users
        will also have the option to type in free text as a response. You can also log into your
        onCourse CMS to make these custom fields, show or be a mandatory question as part of the
        online enrolment, waitlist or mailing list process.</para>
