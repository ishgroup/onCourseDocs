      <title>Payment plans</title>
      <para>A new concept for enrolment fee payments has been developed to allow for online enrolments by paying a deposit, and regular payments thereafter.</para>
      <para>Payment plans consist of scripts which can be applied to classes en masse, and plans in individual classes with payment dates and amounts which can be modified as required.</para>
      <para>The student fee window in the class has changed to allow for more options in creating and setting a class fee with a deposit and then additional amounts payable in relation to the class start date. </para>
      <para>During enrolment, the default option of payment of a payment plan class is for the deposit component only, but additional amounts up to the full class fee can be taken at this time.</para>
      <para>Any discount that applies to an enrolment will be deducted from the final payment amount.</para>
      <para>The invoice window layout has also had significant change to clean up the view and accommodate the payment plan schedule. Within the payment plan invoice, payable amounts and due dates can be adjusted, added or removed, for the individual student. Any invoice can be manually turned into a payment plan invoice if the balance was not paid in full on enrolment.</para>
      <para>The printed invoice template has also been updated to include the payment plan schedule of dates and amounts payable, as have the email templates.</para>
      <para>When a student has an invoice with payment plan amounts due in the future, and they enrol in another course, the future payable components will not be added to their amount payable in Quick Enrol. Only overdue payment amounts will be automatically added.</para>
      <para>A new access right has been created for payment plans. Ensure you update your access roles to allow the appropriate permissions for your staff to create and edit payment plans within both classes and invoices.</para>
      <para>A new chapter of user documentation has been written for Invoices and Payment Plans</para>

      <title>3rd Party Integration preferences</title>
      <para>A new window to create integration preferences has been added to onCourse for the following popular commercial tools:</para>
      <para>Moodle – A free, open-source PHP web application for producing modular internet-based courses that support a modern social constructionist pedagogy</para>
      <para>Mailchimp – Online email marketing solution to manage contacts, send emails and track results</para>
      <para>SurveyMonkey – Create and publish online surveys in minutes, and view the results graphically in real time. SurveyMonkey provides free online questionnaire and survey software</para>
      <para>SurveyGizmo – An exceptionally powerful survey tool designed to make even the most advanced survey projects fun, easy and affordable</para>
      <para>These integrations allow you to create your own links to external services and products you have purchased, and define with a corresponding script how onCourse utilises these services. For more information, read the new onCourse integrations chapter of the user handbook </para>

      <title>Custom field drop down boxes for onCourse and the web</title>
      <para>Custom fields for contact records can now be made into drop down selections of choices for use inside both the onCourse application and on your onCourse enrolment website. This feature allows you to define a list of choices inside the custom field settings, separating each item with a ; e.g. Radio; TV; Internet; *</para>
      <para>If you include an asterisk (*) in the list as per the example above, then your users will also have the option to type in free text as a response. You can also log into your onCourse CMS to make these custom fields, show or be a mandatory question as part of the online enrolment, waitlist or mailing list process.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Retaining outcomes on enrolment cancellation</title>
      <para>Previously, when cancelling an enrolment in onCourse, all the outcomes associated with the enrolment were deleted as part of the cancellation process (unless those outcomes had been used to create a Statement of Attainment or Qualification record in onCourse, in which case they were kept). This meant that for funded courses, withdrawn students needed to be kept as active enrolments in the class to be reported.</para>
      <para>Now when you cancel an enrolment, by default all outcomes with a status set will be retained. This allows you to cancel the enrolment for a funded student, making the place in the class available for another, while retaining their outcomes for reporting.</para>
      <para>During the the enrolment cancellation a checkbox is ticked by default that says ‘Delete outcomes linked to this enrolment with status “not set”’. If you have not given any outcomes a status yet, this may mean all the outcomes attached to the enrolment. This will be desirable for most types of enrolments, where you do not want to report the student as having enrolled in this program at all for AVETMISS purposes.</para>
      <para>If the student needs to be reported as a withdrawn student for AVETMISS purposes, you have two options. Either set the value of the outcomes before the cancellation process, and they will be retained by default. Alternatively, you can untick the option ‘Delete outcomes linked to this enrolment with status “not set”’ so all outcomes, both set and not set, will be retained. To avoid AVETMISS errors, you will need to make sure that any unset outcomes that are retained are given a valid outcomes status, such as 60 – Withdrawn after processing the cancellation.</para>
      <para>There is no change to the cancellation process when cancelling a class. All outcomes will always be deleted, unless they have been used to to create a Statement of Attainment or Qualification record in onCourse before you cancel the class.</para>
    </section>  
    <section>
      <title>Addition of ‘Certificate Awarded’ and ‘Certificate Issued’ fields</title>
      <para>By default, the date the certificate was created on is added to the ‘Certificate Awarded’ and the date the certificate was printed is added to the ‘Certificate issued’ field. For both these new fields, you can manually edit the date to any date you want.</para>
      <para>The default onCourse Statement of Attainment, Qualification and Transcript certificates now show these fields instead of the ‘Created on’ and ‘Printed on’ fields. If you have a custom certificate template and need assistance in updating it, please contact us</para>
    </section>  
    <section>
      <title>Addition of Skills Sets to the Qualification table</title>
      <para>You can now create courses in onCourse linked to Skill Sets rather than full Qualifications. This data is updated weekly from training.gov.au. The wording in various parts of the user interface has been changed to reference Qualification or Skill sets. From a course set up and AVETMISS reporting perspective, a skill set is treated similarly to a qualification. It is only during the certificate issuing process that a special type of Statement of Attainment will be issued, rather than an actual AQF Qualification.</para>
    </section>  
    <section>
      <title>Documentation links added to all onCourse edit window views</title>
      <para>In the bottom left hand corner of each window you will now see a question mark icon. Clicking on this icon will take you directly to the page of the onCourse user documentation that explains how to use that part of onCourse. The link to the top level of the documentation is still available in the Help menu.</para>
    </section>      
    <section>
      <title>User defined payment types</title>
      <para>onCourse now allows you to add your own type of payment methods, for example, VET FEE HELP, B-Pay or PayPal. You can also edit any existing payment type that is included in onCourse, or remove a payment type that you don’t allow at your organisation e.g. cheque, provided you have never taken any payments by that method.</para>
    </section>    
    <section>
      <title>Banking window restructure</title>
      <para>The new banking window allows you to see all payment in and out transactions grouped together on their banking date, including those banked automatically such as credit card and EFTPOS. This will assist with reconciliation process, as well as allow you to easily locate and edit the banking dates of transactions such as EFT/direct deposit. To access this window from the top menu by clicking on Financial -> Banking. You can manually bank money from this window by clicking on the ‘+’ icon inside the banking list view. Alternatively, the ‘Deposit banking’ window can still be accessed in the ‘Accounts’ tab of the dashboard.</para>
    </section>    
    <section>
      <title>Transfer enrolment wizard</title>
      <para>A transfer enrolment process has been added to the enrolment window cog wheel function. This is similar to the ‘cancel enrolment’ process with the addition of opening Quick Enrol at the end of the process, pre loaded with the student, payer and course details, allowing you to make a speedy transfer of the student to another class.</para>
    </section>        
    <section>
      <title>Re-style of all reports</title>
      <para>All standard reports have been reformatted for a more consistent look and feel, and to simplify the templates for custom changes.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Rebuild of all onCourse exports</title>
      <para>All export CSV, XML and other custom templates have been migrated to Groovy. This significantly reduces the load on your server when running large data sets for export, and allows for much simpler custom export editing.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>New preferences windows</title>
      <para>All onCourse preferences settings have been moved into a single window with a more intuitive layout. Under File > Preferences > General… you’ll find all the general preferences previously available (College, Licences, Messaging, Class Defaults, LDAP, Maintenance and AVETMISS).</para>
      <para>Financial general preferences has been merged into this window and a new preference has been created for adding Holidays (unavailabilities) for your whole of business timetable and scheduling availability.</para>
