      <title>Automated printing and portal distribution of Certificates of Attendance</title>
      <para>A new set of features involving onCourse scripts, email templates, post class
        satisfaction surveys and document uploads to the skillsOnCourse portal comes together in a
        new feature set for automatic distribution of Attendance Certificates for non-VET
        courses.</para>
      <para>Each day, for classes that ended the previous day, onCourse will create and upload to
        the student portal a Certificate of Attendance for each enrolled student. Optionally, you
        can set the script to check attendance has also reached a certain threshold, like 80%,
        before issuing this certificate.</para>
      <para>For students issued with a certificate, a new email template will be sent with a one
        time password free login link to take them straight to the portal page where they can then
        download and print their certificate.</para>
      <para>The default wording in the email template encourages the studen to complete the simple
        satisfaction survey built into the portal, so you can start collecting 5 star ratings for
        the class venue, tutor and content, plus an optional comment.</para>
      <para>As per all new scripts and templates, this is disabled by default, and we encourage you
        to customise the wording of the 'Certificate available' email before activating this script
        at your college.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Automated creation of VET Certificates</title>
      <para>Unlike non-VET Certificates of Attendance, formal VET certifications like Statements of
        Attainment and Qualifications can only be issued when a student achieves outcome results for
        the units that make up their course. </para>
      <para>A new script in onCourse checks daily for any outcome results which have been updated
        during the previous 24 hours, and if all the outcomes attached to the enrolment have be set
        to have an outcome status, a VET certification will be created.</para>
      <para>Where the student has successfully achieved all outcomes linked to a course which is set
        to 'satisfies complete qualification or skill set', then they will be issued a Qualification
        or Skill Set Certificate on completion. If all outcomes have been marked, and some are
        unsuccessful, they will be issued a Statement of Attainment instead.</para>
      <para>For students undertaking a short course, who have successfully, or a mix of successfully
        and unsuccessfuly completed their outcomes, a Statement of Attainment will also be
        created.</para>

    <section>
      <title>onCourse Menu Restructure</title>
      <para>To improve clarity and ensure all new onCourse features have a home in the menu system,
        we have restructured the top level menus to better group related items.</para>
      <para>A new menu option called 'Products' includes all the items you can sell via onCourse,
        including Courses, Gift Vouchers and Memberships. </para>
      <para>The menu item 'Training' contains the features related to setting up and scheduling
        training, including items such as Classes, Sites and Documents.</para>
      <para>The previous menu 'People' has been split into two menus: The new 'People' menu contains
        the options to access contacts and their communication history via mailing lists and
        messages, while the  new 'Activity' menu is where you will find Quick Enrol and all the
        results of contact engagement with onCourse including Applications, Enrolments, Certificates
        and Sales.</para>
      <para>All options related to fees and payments, including CorporatePasses and Discounts can be
        found under the 'Financial' menu.</para>
      <para>The File, Edit, Windows and Help menu options are unchanged.</para>
