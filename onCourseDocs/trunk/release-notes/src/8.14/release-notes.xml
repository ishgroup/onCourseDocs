      <title>Automated printing and portal distribution of Certificates of Attendance</title>
      <para>A new set of features involving onCourse scripts, email templates, post class
        satisfaction surveys and document uploads to the skillsOnCourse portal comes together in a
        new feature set for automatic distribution of Attendance Certificates for non-VET
        courses.</para>
      <para>Each day, for classes that ended the previous day, onCourse will create and upload to
        the student portal a Certificate of Attendance for each enrolled student. Optionally, you
        can set the script to check attendance has also reached a certain threshold, like 80%,
        before issuing this certificate.</para>
      <para>For students issued with a certificate, a new email template will be sent with a one
        time password free login link to take them straight to the portal page where they can then
        download and print their certificate.</para>
      <para>The default wording in the email template encourages the studen to complete the simple
        satisfaction survey built into the portal, so you can start collecting 5 star ratings for
        the class venue, tutor and content, plus an optional comment.</para>
      <para>As per all new scripts and templates, this is disabled by default, and we encourage you
        to customise the wording of the 'Certificate available' email before activating this script
        at your college.</para>
