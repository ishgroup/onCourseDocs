  <title>Distribution of VET Certificates through the portal</title>
  <para>A new script has been added to automatically print and distribute VET Certificates through
        the skillsOnCourse portal called 'send certificate vet created notification'. Like all new
        scripts, it is disabled by default and you will need to enable it if you wish to use
        it.</para>
      <para>Each day, all unprinted VET Certificates for student who have a validated USI will be
        printed to PDF and saved to the student's enrolment record. </para>
      <para>You will need to make sure you have created and uploaded the following three two page
        background documents to onCourse before enabling this script:
        vet_qualification_background.pdf, vet_skillset_background.pdf, and vet_soa_background.pdf.
        The script will overlay the certificate template on the correct background type during the
        print process.</para>
      <para>The Certificate will then be uploaded to the student portal, and the student sent an
        email notifying them is available for download.</para>
      <para>The same email template, 'Certificate available', also called on by the non-VET
        Certificate of Attendance distribution script is sent. Ensure any modifications you make to
        the template suit the receiptent of both VET and non-VET certificates, or create a copy of
        the template to send a different email to VET certified students.</para>
