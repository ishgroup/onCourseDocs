  <title>Default invoice terms per contact</title>
  <para>A new field has been added to the general preferences to allow for a default due date for
        all invoices to be set. Previously, the default due date was always the day of creation. In
        addition, each contact in onCourse can have their own default due date that overrides the
        default, so you can offer a range of relative terms like 7 days, 14 days, 31 days to auto
        calculate an invoice due date for your corporate clients. This features ties in with the new
        invoice payment due reminder script and portal payment gateway also included in this
        release.</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>A new script has been added to onCourse called 'notification of unmarked attendance'. When
          enabled, this script sends a daily notification to advise an admin user of any sessions
          run the previous day where attendance was all or partially unmarked. If you have scripts
          enabled that rely on tutors electronically marking the roll, we suggest you enable this
          monitoring script also. <systemitem>#26608</systemitem></para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>A new script has been added to onCourse called 'send payment plan reminder'. When enabled,
          this script sends a reminder to the invoice payer if they have a payment due within the
          next 7 days or if they have a payment overdue. The email template link includes a password
          free one time login to the portal payment gateway to make the payment via credit card
