  <title>Automatically generate verification QR code for certificates</title>
  <para>In preparation for the deployment of the onCourse Certificate Verification service,
        Statements of Attainment and Qualifications can now be printed with a unique QR (Quick
        Response) code and URL verification code.</para>
  <para>The Certificate Verification service will allow employers or other RTOs to confirm the
        certificate was issued to the student named without requiring them phone, or otherwise
        contact the RTO to request look up of the Certificate number in the register.</para>
      <para>This web portal feature is currently in testing and will be deployed shortly. All RTOs
        wishing to use this portal should check the default location of the QR code on their
        certificate template and make adjustments as necessary. Certificates can also be printed
        without QR codes if you do not wish to implement this feature.</para>
