      <title>Discount override at the class level</title>
      <para>This new feature allows you to override the discount value at the class level, to assign
        varying class fees sharing the same discount name. This option may be especially useful for
        funded programs like Smart &amp; Skilled. For example, a number of courses and classes can
        share the discount 'First Qualification rate' but each class can have it's own discounted
        price. Double click on the discount in the class budget tab to edit it.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Discount offset from class start date</title>
      <para>In addition to discounts running for a set date period, discounts can now be set to be
        valid as an offset from the class start date. The offset can allow the discount to run prior
        to the start date, or after the start date. This will allow the creation of both early bird
        style pricing and discounts for in-term enrolments.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Prior learning edit and export</title>
      <para>Prior learning data imported into onCourse now has its own view in the contact education
        tab. These records can be double clicked to edit, and new records can be added manually. All
        prior learning data added manually or via import will also be collected and exported in
        whole of college date range AVETMISS reporting.</para>
