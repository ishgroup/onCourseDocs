	<section>
		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>skillsOnCourse is a web site for tutors and students which allows them to interact with your
			college and with each other. Every student and tutor is automatically given a login when their
			record is created in onCourse or when they enrol online. skillsOnCourse has been optimised for
			mobile and touch pad devices, as well as desktop browsers.</para>
		<para>skillsOnCourse gives tutors the information they need without having to contact you
			regularly. "Is my class full?", "Will my class go ahead?", "Can I get a class roll", "I need
			to get a message out to my students before the next session." These are all things that your
			teaching staff will ask you every day; now you have a 24 hour assistant to help tutors get the
			answers they need.</para>
		<para>Students will also enjoy the skillsOnCourse portal. They can quickly and easily get the
			information they need about their classes and timetable, as well as interact with other
			students and their tutors.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Creating accounts and logging in</title>
		<para>All students when they are created in onCourse, will automatically have a skillsOnCourse
			account set up for them. The first time a student enrols in your college, they will be sent an
			email which allows them to log into skillsOnCourse and set their password. Tutors are also
			given an account when their record is created in onCourse.</para>
		<para>The skillsOnCourse login screen will prompt the student or tutor to enter their details.
			Like the onCourse enrolment process, a student is identified by name and email address to
			avoid forcing students and tutors remember another user id.</para>

			<title>Recovering and Resetting Passwords</title>
			<para>The main login screen for the skillsOnCourse portal includes a 'forgot password' link. The
				user will need to provide a name and valid email address in order to initiate the process.
				If the student or tutor does not have an email address in onCourse then they must contact
				the college so that you can manually update their record. It is important that you implement
				an appropriate set of policies around how to authenticate users over the phone when they
				request that their email address be changed or added, since that email address will give
				them access to the full profile and history of the user. </para>
			<para>If the user clicks on the forgot password link and enters the other details, an email will
				be sent to them with a link to enable them create a new password. This link will be valid
				for 24 hours only, after that time the link within the email will not work. Once the student
				has reset their password, they can continue using skillsOnCourse.</para>
			<para><programlisting>Dear {name},

To reset your SkillsOnCourse password, simply click the link below. That will take you to a web page
where you can create a new password. Please note that the link will expire 24 hours after
this email was sent.
				
  {recoveryLink}

If you weren't trying to reset your password, don't worry - your account is still secure and no
one has been given access to it. Most likely, someone just mistyped their email address
while trying to reset their own password.</programlisting></para>

			<title>Updating Your Details</title>
			<para>Once logged in, users are able to update their contact details via the 'My Profile'
				menu. This screen also enables them to update their password and subscribe to receive
				marketing material via email SMS or post, as well as signing up to receive a regular
				newsletter. </para>

		<title>Navigating skillsOnCourse</title>
		<para>Students and Tutors are able to navigate their way around skillsOnCourse via the left hand
			menu options. By clicking on the 'skillsOnCourse' logo in the top left hand corner of the
			page, they can return to the home page of the site. Because the site is built using modern
			html techniques, the user can safely use the back button on their browser or bookmark any page
			they like. When they return to a bookmarked page they will be asked to log in and will then be
			redirected to the page they bookmarked.</para>
		<para>If a student or tutor is updating their profile, they must submit their changes before
			navigating away from that page. The same logic applies to any new posts / messages to the
			forum and if a student is submitting a rating for a given class. If they leave the page
			without saving the changes, those changes are lost.</para>

		<title>Timetable Information</title>
		<para>The user timetable can be viewed as either a list of sessions or as a month or calendar
			view. The timetable will display all classes on a given day, by clicking on a given day the
			session information will display at the bottom of the page, including course name, room, venue
			and tutor information. Timetables are applicable either to classes a student is enrolled in,
			or to sessions being taught by a tutor.</para>

		<title>Discussion Forum</title>
		<para>A discussion forum is available as a resource to class tutors and students. Each forum is
			specific to a given class and can be switched on or off by the College when the class is
			created within onCourse. The forum can also be set up to be automatically disabled a certain
			number of days after the class finished. This forum, which is moderated by the tutor, enables
			tutors and students to discuss, within a secure environment, all aspects of a given
			class.</para>
		<para>All communication is visible to the entire class. Direct contact between students is not
			available for privacy and personal security reasons, and is not always appropriate in a shared
			learning environment. Should a student wish to contact another student privately they should
			exchange personal contact details outside of skillsOnCourse</para>

		<para>Students can access up to date class information such as the date of the next session,

			receive course related messages from Tutors and fellow students. </para>
		<para>Tutors can submit the course materials documents to the College in advance of the class in
			order for them to be made available to students. Class materials will be uploaded by College
			staff via the onCourse client as attachments (PDF is the best format for ease of use on many
			systems) and flagged as 'web visible (private)'. Both tutors and students will be able to
			access and download these PDF documents from skillsOnCourse. At this stage it is not possible
			for tutors to directly upload attachments for their class, since the college needs to review
			content to ensure it is appropriate and has the appropriate copyright clearance.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Viewing and Marking a Class Roll</title>
			<para>Tutors can access the attendance roll for the class they are teaching, updating the
				attendance records in real time. As skillsOnCourse is enabled for mobile devices and touch
				pads, this makes it even simpler to update attendance rolls in real time. The attendance
				roll can also list contact details such as mobile and email addresses for students, allowing
				the tutor to easily contact students who have not shown up for their scheduled
				classes.</para>

			<title>Viewing of Survey Results</title>
			<para>Once a student completes the survey, the tutor is able to view those results. This
				provides the tutor with an overall average of ranking results for tutor, course and venue
				for a given class or classes. As well as giving the tutor the ability to review all comments

		<title>Student Specific Features</title>
		<para>Students have their own feature set, including the ability to update their account
			details, access forums and message boards, as well as complete an online survey for a class
			that they have completed. It is also an invaluable resource for accessing and downloading
			class materials in advance of a given class.</para>
		<para>If a student enrols in a class that has an online forum, the College will specify the
			amount of time students within that class will have access to that forum after the completion
			of the class. If for example the tutor wishes to send the students additional information and
			or continue with a discussion, the forum can remain open to allow that communication to take
			place.</para>
		<para>The skillsOnCourse account will remain open for the student to access indefinitely, even if
			a forum is no longer available to the student. </para>
		<section>
			<title>Rating Classes</title>
			<para>Class students will now have the ability to provide a 'rating' for the class they have
				completed. This rating is based upon three key criteria, tutor, course and venue. The
				student simply selects the number of stars to be given to each of these criteria. </para>
			<para>Students can provide a written comment within this survey function. The student can
				decide whether the comment can be published by the College for use in future marketing
				activity such as testimonials. The survey screen will include a brief statement asking the
				student to confirm if they want their comment to be made publicly available, they give their
				consent via a tick box on screen. The student has the further ability to post an 'anonymous'
				comment or be identified by their first name and initial of surname.</para>

			<title>Contributing to Class Forums</title>
			<para>If a student enrols in a class that has an online forum, they are able to participate in
				that forum, by either adding comments to an existing discussion thread or by adding a new
				discussion thread within the forum. As the tutor is the overall moderator of the forum, it
				is only them (and not the student) who can delete comments that are deemed inappropriate. </para>
			<para>The class forum can remain open after a class has been completed, if the students of the
				class and the tutor want to continue their online communications. </para>

		<title>Guide to Managing the skillsOnCourse for college staff </title>
		<para>skillsOnCourse provides a range of new functionality for college staff, providing a number
			of improvements to communication methods between students and college staff, as well as
			between college staff and their tutors</para>
		<section>
			<title>Uploading of PDF Documents </title>
			<para>College staff will be able to upload a PDF document or other documents via the class or
				course edit window of onCourse. Each attachment can be flagged as 'web visible (private)' in
				order to make it visible only to student enrolled in the class. Setting the attachment as
				'web visible (public)' means that it is visible to everyone browsing the main college
				website. Use this option for things students will need before making a decision to enrol.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Creation of Forums for Classes</title>
			<para>The College will have the ability to nominate as to whether a forum is appropriate for a
				given class, as not all classes will require a forum. This configuration is managed within
				the class edit window of onCourse. </para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>New Reporting Functionality for Class Surveys</title>
			<para>New reports are available in onCourse to provide summary and detailed views of all class
				survey results. As the survey itself is based upon the three key parameters of rating the
				tutor, course and venue, this provides Colleges with a much greater level of analysis of
				classes across all types and subjects. It also provides the College with access to
				invaluable testimonials and comments from students, if the student has given their approval
				for their comments to be published. </para>
