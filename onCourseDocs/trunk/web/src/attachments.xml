	<title>Attaching images and documents</title>
	<section>
		<title>Adding files</title>
		<para>onCourse provides an effortless way to display images and documents (for example JPG, PNG,
			GIF and PDF files) with your website. Within onCourse add attachment by the Resource
			menu and creating a new Attachment record. Using this tool you can upload pictures and
			other attachments. There is a limit of 10Mb for any file you try to upload in this way.
			Larger files, such as video, are better hosted with specialised services such as
			YouTube.</para>
		<para>Alternatively, you can upload or link attachments directly from the edit view inside
			Course, Class, Tutor, Student, Site or many other places within onCourse. This links the
			attachment directly to that resource.</para>
			
			<section><title>Duplicate files</title><para>onCourse is
				clever enough to de-duplicate files when you upload them. So if you add a 1Mb PDF to
				the system and then sometime later upload the same file again to onCourse, only one
				copy will be stored and linked to both places. This reduces the size of your
				database. In order for this to work, the two files must be absolutely identical. The
				slightest difference and the two files will be both stored.</para></section>

	<section>
		<title>Displaying media online</title>
		<para>If you wish to display attachments and images on your website, firstly make sure that you
			have ticked the "available on web" option for that attachment inside onCourse. Then you
			have several ways of showing content online, depending on where you want to display
			it.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Linked to specific pages</title>
			<para>If you attach a file to a course and mark it as 'available on web' that attachment will be
				shown on the course description page. This makes it very simple to add pictures or
				perhaps a PDF with further course information. Remember that Google and other search
				engines will not do a good job with indexing content in Word, PDF or other formats.
				So if you want the best exposure online and the best search engine results, put your
				course descriptions as text directly into the course description.</para>
			<para>Attaching a PDF to the course can be useful for specific files such as a pre-enrolment questionnaire, additional information
				about course requirements, software exercise files, and so on. Including these files is achieved exactly the same way as including
				an image on your page... open the Course, click the Web tab and then the Plus sign to browse the files. We recommend documents are
				uploaded as PDF as they can be universally accessed no matter what computer the student is running.</para>

		<title>Rich text</title>
		<para>Sometimes you want to position images and attachments not just at the end of the
			course description, but on other pages withint your site. You may want to display an
			image on a regular CMS page or link to a course handbook pdf download within a block in
			the side margin on your site. Any rich text enabled text field within onCourse can
			display this content, such as:<simplelist>
				<member>pages</member>
				<member>blocks</member>
				<member>course description</member>
				<member>tutor resume</member>
				<member>class description</member>
				<member>site description</member>
			</simplelist></para>
		<section xml:id="images_and_attachments-image">
			<title>{image}</title>
			<para>You may want to attach images and other files to courses, classes, sites, rooms
				and tutors and have them appear on the website. This is easy to do. Just attach the
				file you want in onCourse, mark it as 'Visible on web' and that file will be
				automatically transferred and attached to your site. These files will appear by
				default at the bottom of the relevant page. So for instance, just attach a PDF to a
				course to have that document appear as a link at the bottom of the course
				description. Likewise, pictures will appear at the bottom of the page. If however
				you would like to position the image somewhere else (say, next to the relevant
				paragraph of text) you can do so with a special rich text entry called
				{image}.</para>

						<listitem>
							<para>Optional. The name of the image. If this is not given and the id
								is also not given, then a random image is displayed from those
								linked to the relevant database object. For example, if the rich
								text is a course description, then the random image will be one of
								the images linked to that course; if the rich text is a tutor
								profile, then the random image will be chosen from those attached to
								the tutor.</para>
