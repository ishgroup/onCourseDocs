        <para>One of the key features of onCourse is the integrated website. This allows you to
            promote your courses via your website with seamless online enrolments, waiting lists,
            mailing lists, discounts, credit card payments, student and tutor portals and much more. </para>

    <section xml:id="onlineUpdating"> <title>Updating your site</title>
        <para>Because onCourse has been written as one comprehensive system, updating your website
            is completely autoamted and painless. Every time you make a change to any relevant
            information those changes are automatically uploaded to your website without you having
            to do anything specific. This means for example that as courses are filled, the website
            automatically updates to show prospective students that places are limited.</para>

        <para>onCourse makes the uploading and downloading of information (the replication)
            foolproof so that you don't have to worry about it. Replication was designed by ish to
            work perfectly even after your internet connection has been offline for a while (say,
            because your ISP had an outage). onCourse is designed to not require high performance
            internet links, so you can use very low cost ADSL and because you aren't hosting the
            website in your office, you don't need to invest in expensive, high performance, high
            reliability internet connections (such as SHDSL which are typically $400 / month and
            up). You also don't need servers which provide 24×7 web access for students or have
            backup power and generators to ensure high reliability website servic with a 24 hour
            climate controlled server room in a secure facility which complies with the
            Mastercard/Visa PCI security regulations .ish already does all that for you.</para>
        <para>All you need are the computers you own today and a plain, simple low-cost internet link to run onCourse. We provide the
            rest.</para>

                the course, what students should bring, pre-requisites, outcomes and anything else
                you can think of. As this is the course, this information needs to pertain to all
                the classes of this course. If you have class specific information you should put

    <section xml:id="onlineAdvancedSearch"> <title>Advanced Search Options</title>
        <para>onCourse includes a Solr search engine indexed to your website. This allows users to use the
            built in simple or advanced search tools on your webpages to find the courses they are
            looking for, or for you to craft URLs which include certain search results.</para>
        <para>You can also choose to include only courses tagged with a set tag group in your search
            engine index, this is commonly done when providers have multiple websites for different
            training departments. i.e. the workplace learning site only ever searches on and shows
            results tagged with professional development, while the community site indexes all
            courses.</para>
        <para>The sort order for course results in a list view page prioritises courses with classes
            starting next. When a search parameter is added into a page, the sort order is shifted
            to bring results with a greater relevancy to the top of the page, and then to sort by
            classes starting next. </para>
        <para>To see the scoring priority for each course in a search result, add the string
            ?debugQuery=true to the end of your URL.</para>
        <para>When adding a 'near=' search, it will automatically hide results outside of 100km
            radius the search suburbs' GPO. This can be useful if you deliver in seperated
            locations. For example, a website visitor who searches for courses in Sydney is unlikely
            to be interested in results in Melbourne, but may be interested in results in Chatswood.
            In this case the Melbourne classes would be suppressed from the list but shown to the
            user if they click the button 'Show other classes'</para>
        <para>Classes that are full or cancelled are suppressed from the course results.</para>
        <para>If you wanted to craft some specific searches to put behind image banners, promotional
            ads or other links, you can build your search within a tag group URL to make the results
            more specific. For example, if you want a promo for day time cooking classes your search
            might be www.myurl.com/courses/cooking?time=day which will find all the courses tagged
            with the subject tag group named cooking that have classes running during the day time.</para>
        <para>The onCourse search options available are:</para>

                        course description.</para>

                        you will need to find a class that is online and one the tutor currently teaches. Then right click on their name, in the class block,
                        and open the link in a new window/tab. The tutors ID will be the last few digits of the URL. So if the URL is www.yoursite.com.au/tutor/3, then the tutor ID is 3.</para>

                    <para>This search allows you search for courses that are tagged with multiple tags. You must
                        use the full secondary tag path. This means the course is tagged with both
                        the landing page tag (usually the tag group from within the subjects tag)
                        and the search term tag.</para>

        <para>Multiple search teams can be concatenated to created complex search strings such as

            which is searching inside the subject tag group cooking for courses also tagged with the
            level tag group beginner that contain the keyword Thai, held near Chatswood NSW in the
            day time and costing under $500.</para>
        <note>
            <para>A note on the space character inside a URL: If you have a tag name that contains a space,
                and you are manually crafting a URL that includes that tag, you need to replace the
                space character with "+" e.g. tag name "cooking for kids" in a URL becomes
                "cooking+for+kids". This is done automatically for pages generated by onCourse, it
                is only in hand crafted URLs you need to remember to add the space delimiter. "%20"
                works also, but makes the URL harder for a human to read.</para>

        <section xml:id="onlineAdvnacedFiltering"><title>Filtering class results using advanced search</title>
            <para>Advanced search parametres can also be added to specific course pages, to filter the list of
                results returned. This can be a useful function when you offer the same course in
                multiple locations, but users only want to see the classes from a specific
                location.</para>
            <para>These search options are appended to a standard course page, with the URL
                containing the course code. In these examples, course code ABC123 is used. </para>

        <para>Faceted search uses a hierarchy structure to enable users to browse information by choosing
            from a pre-determined set of categories. This allows a user to type in their simple
            query, then refine their search options by navigating. In reality, it's an advanced
            search going on in the background, but instead of the user having to think of the
            additional search categories, it's been made easier for them by the visible folder
            structure. Examples of other websites that use it are Amazon and eBay.</para>
        <para>You can select more than one option in the faceted search which will allow you to view
            more than categories results.</para>
        <para>In the example below ther has been one option selected in the Locations tag and two
            options in the Courses tag. The courses that are displayed will be ones that are being
            taught in Sydney that have either been tagged to Barista &amp; Coffee Art or RSA Course.
            The URL that is generated after the domain name from this search is

                    ecommerce details of people who visit your site, so not only can you see who is
                    coming to your site and from where, but you can see which sources of traffic
                    result in actual money being spent. It is all very well to get thousands of page
                    views from Facebook, but unless that traffic is generating enrolments you aren't
