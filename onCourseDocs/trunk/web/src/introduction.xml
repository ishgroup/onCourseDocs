	<title>Creating an onCourse website</title>
	<section>
		<title>Your college online</title>
		<para>One of the key features of onCourse is the integrated website. This allows you to promote
			your courses and products on your website and provide seamless online enrolments,
			waiting lists, mailing lists, discounts, credit card payments, student and tutor portals
			and much more.</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Updating your site</title>
		<para>Because ish onCourse has been written as one comprehensive system, updating your web site is
			completely painless. Every time you make a change to any relevant information those
			changes are automatically uploaded to your web site in the background. So, as courses
			are filled, the web site shows prospective students that places are limited. This works
			equally well if you are hosting onCourse yourself or in our cloud service.</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Enabling courses for online display</title>
		<para>Courses need to be <command>Enabled and visible online</command> in the General tab of each
			course, to display on your site.</para>
		<mediaobject>
			<imageobject>
				<imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/visibleOnline.png"/>
			</imageobject>
			<caption>
				<para>Selecting this option will display the course online</para>
			</caption>
		</mediaobject>
		<para>You must also tag your courses with Subject tags for them to display on your web site
			browsing navigation. You may choose to allow subject tags to be set more than once, or
			limit to one. If a course is tagged with more than one subject, it will appear in the
			menu for each tag you have assigned. Check the onCourse manual for more on
			tagging.</para>

			<caption>
				<para> Example of a welcome page and Subject tags at the bottom</para>
			</caption>
		</mediaobject>
		<section>
			<title>Course description</title>
			<para>The field <command>web description</command> is where you should enter all the information
				about the course description, what people should bring, pre-requisites, outcomes and
				anything else you can think of. As this is the course, this information needs to
				pertain to all the classes of this course. If you have class specific information
				you should put this in the class web description.</para>
			<para>The description fields are rich text fields, so you can use bullets, headings and numbered lists. See <xref xlink:href="#richText"/> for more on this. You can also include images and attachments in your pages.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Displaying Classes</title>
			<para>Once a course has been tagged and enabled for the web, classes in that course will be
				displayed if they have the “Enrolment allowed and visible online” option selected in
				their “General” tab. The classes themselves do not need to be tagged with anything
				from the Subjects tag group in order to appear on the website. You can also select a
				series of classes in the list view and select the cog wheel option <command>Show
					class on website</command> to web enable classes in bulk.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Class descriptions</title>
			<para>The information that you put in this field should be specific for just this instance of the class. Keep your general course
				information in the course itself.</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Summary</title>
			<itemizedlist>
				<title>Here are some handy tips to help ensure that courses/classes appear on the main page of the website.</title>
				<listitem>
					<para>Courses have “Enabled and visible online” selected on the General tab</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Courses are tagged with at least one tag under Subjects in the tag group (if it has multiple tags, this course will appear
						under each tag)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Ensure "Enrolment allowed and visible online” is selected on the "General" tab of every class you want to appear on your
						website.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Other information</title>
		<para>Other information which makes its way automatically to your website includes tutors, rooms and sites. In particular, be sure to
			fill out the latitude and longitude of the sites since this will automatically give the website the ability to show a Google Maps
			driven location finder for students trying to find the venue.</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Special Pages</title>
		<para>Some URLs in your site are reserved for special pages. These pages are delivered by the onCourse software itself. To customise
			them, consult the templates chapter for details of how these pages are created. These pages include:<variablelist>

			<title>Advanced Search options</title>
		<para>onCourse includes a Solr search engine indexed to your website. This allows users to use the
			built in simple or advanced search tools on your webpages to find the courses they are
			looking for, or for you to craft URLs which include certain search results.</para>
		<para>You can also choose to include only courses tagged with a set tag group in your search
			engine index, which is commonly done when a college has multiple websites for different
			training departments. i.e. the workplace learning site only ever searches on and shows
			results tagged with professional development, while the community site indexes all
			courses.</para>
		<para>The usual sort order for course results in a list view page prioritises courses with classes
			starting next. When a search parameter is added into a page, the sort order is shifted
			to bring results with a greater relevancy to the top of the page, and then to sort by
			classes starting next. </para>
		<para>To see the scoring priority for each course in a search result, add the string
			?debugQuery=true to the end of your URL.</para>
		<para>When adding a 'near=' search, it will automatically hide results outside of 100km radius the
			search suburbs' GPO. This can be useful if you deliver in a variety of physically
			seperated locations. For example, a website visitor who searches for courses in Sydney
			is unlikely to be interested in results in Melbourne, but may be interested in results
			in Chatswood. In this case the Melbourne class results would be suppressed from the list
			but shown to the user if they click the button 'Show other classes'</para>
		<para>Classes that are full or classes that are cancelled are suppressed from results list
			pages in the same way.</para>
		<para>Searches created by website users are always run against all your courses e.g.
			www.myurl.com/courses?s=whatever</para>
		<para>If you want to craft some specific searches to put behind image banners, promotional
			ads or other links, you can build your search within a tag group URL to make the results
			more specific. For example, if you want a promo for day time cooking classes your search
			might be www.myurl.com/courses/cooking?time=day which will find all the courses tagged
			with the subject tag group named cooking that have classes running during the day
			time.</para>
		<para>The onCourse search options available are:</para>
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?s=cook</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This is standard keyword search, which includes stemming so the term cook will find cook,
						cooks, cooking, cookery ect. The search results prioritise courses where the
						search term appears in the course name, over courses where it appears in the
						course description.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?near=Chatswood+2057</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>Search on both the Suburb+postcode. While the search may work without the postcode,
						adding the postcode is essential to determine location if the suburb exists
						in multiple states.</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?price=200</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This searches for classes with an enrolment fee less than the specified dollar
						value.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?tutorId=1234</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This searches for all classes that the tutor with ID number 1234 is currently teaching. To find what a tutors ID is 
						you will need to find a class that is online and one the tutor currently teaches. Then right click on their name, in the class block,
						and open the link in a new window/tab. The tutors ID will be the last few digits of the URL. So if the URL is www.yoursite.com.au/tutor/3, then the tutor ID is 3.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?time=day</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>Searching for a day class means the first session commences before 5pm.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?time=evening</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>Searching evening means the session starts after 5pm.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?day=mon</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This searches for a class where the first session is on Monday.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?day=tues</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This searches for a class where the first session is on Tuesday.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?day=wed</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This searches for a class where the first session is on Wednesday.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?day=thurs</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This searches for a class where the first session is on Thursday.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?day=fri</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This searches for a class where the first session is on Friday.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>

					<para>This searches for a class where the first session is on Saturday.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?day=sun</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This searches for a class where the first session is on Sunday.</para>
				</listitem>

				<term>/courses?day=weekday</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>A weekday class means the first session is held Monday to Friday.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?day=weekend</term>
				<listitem><para>A weekend search means the class starts on a Saturday or Sunday.</para></listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?after=20141201</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This will show class that start after the date 1/12/2014. The date in the search is in format yyyymmdd.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses?before=20150101</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This will show classes that start before 1/1/2015. The date in the search is in format
						yyyymmdd. This can be used in combination with the after search option to
						create a date range. </para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>/courses/cooking?tag=delivery/School+holidays</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>This search allows you search for courses that are tagged with multiple tags. You must
						use the full secondary tag path. This means the course is tagged with both
						the landing page tag (usually the tag group from within the subjects tag)
						and the search term tag.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>
		<para>Multiple search teams can be concatenated to created complex search strings such as
			www.myurl.com/courses/cooking?s=thai&amp;near=Chatswood+2057&amp;price=500&amp;time=day&amp;tag=level/beginner
			which is searching inside the subject tag group cooking for courses also tagged with the
			level tag group beginner that contain the keyword Thai, held near Chatswood NSW in the
			day time and costing under $500.</para>
		<note>
			<para>A note on the space character inside a URL: If you have a tag name that contains a space,
				and you are manually crafting a URL that includes that tag, you need to replace the
				space character with "+" e.g. tag name "cooking for kids" in a URL becomes
				"cooking+for+kids". This is done automatically for pages generated by onCourse, it
				is only in hand crafted URLs you need to remember to add the space delimiter. "%20"
				works also, but makes the URL harder for a human to read.</para>
		</note>
<section>
	<title>
		Filtering class results using advanced search
	</title>
	<para>Advanced search parametres can also be added to specific course pages, to filter the list of
				results returned. This can be a useful function when you offer the same course in
				multiple locations, but users only want to see the classes from a specific
				location.</para>
			<para>These search options are appended to a standard course page, with the URL
				containing the course code. In these examples, I'll use the course code
				ABC123.</para>
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>/course/ABC123/?near=Chatswood+2057</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Search on both the Suburb+postcode. While the search may work without the postcode,
							adding the postcode is essential to determine location if the suburb exists
							in multiple states.</para></listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>/course/ABC123/?time=day</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Searching for day classes of a course means the first session commences before
							5pm.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>/course/ABC123/?time=evening</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Searching evening classes of a course means the first session starts after 5pm.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

		<title>Faceted Search</title>
		<para>Faceted search uses a hierarchy structure to enable users to browse information by choosing
			from a pre-determined set of categories. This allows a user to type in their simple
			query, then refine their search options by navigating. In reality, it's an advanced
			search going on in the background, but instead of the user having to think of the
			additional search categories, it's been made easier for them by the visible folder
			structure. Examples of other websites that use it are Amazon and eBay.</para>
		<para>You can select more than one option in the faceted search which will allow you to view
			more than categories results.</para>
		<para>In the example below ther has been one option selected in the Locations tag and two
			options in the Courses tag. The courses that are displayed will be ones that are being
			taught in Sydney that have either been tagged to Barista &amp; Coffee Art or RSA Course.
			The URL that is generated after the domain name from this search is
			/courses/barista+%26+coffee+art+courses?tag=/rsa+courses&amp;near=sydney/2000/5</para>

				<para>Example of how the faceted search is used</para>

		</mediaobject>
		<para>If you only selected the Sydney option above then the URL you would get is
			/courses?near=sydney/2000/5; if you only selected RSA Courses then the URL you would get
			is /courses/rsa+courses; and if you selected both Sydney and RSA Courses then the URL
			you would get is /courses/rsa+courses?near=sydney/2000/5.</para>
