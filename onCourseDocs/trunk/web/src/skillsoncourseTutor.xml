        <title>Tutor Specific Features</title>
        <para>Some features are only visible to tutors, including real time marking of the
            attendance roll for their classes.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Viewing and Marking a Class Roll</title>
            <para>Tutors can access the attendance roll for the class they are teaching, updating
                the attendance records in real time. Only class rolls for sessions in the past, or
                in progress, can be marked.</para>
            <para>If you have uploaded student profile images in onCourse, their image will appear
                along side their name assisting the tutors in verifying their identify. onCourse is
                also integrated with Gravatar, so if students have a loaded a profile image against
                a Gravatar profile using the same email address as they use in onCourse, this image
                will be used.</para>
            <para>Students can be marked as attended, partially attended, absent or absent with
                reason. For both partially attended and absent with a reason a note can be recorded
                against the attendance record to provide more information.</para>
            <para>Marked attendance data is then used to calculate the student's attendance
                percentage. This percentage may be important for reasons like CRICOS student visa
                compliance, or the college's own minimum attendance requirements in order to be
                eligible for a certificate of attendance.</para>
            <para>The attendance roll can also list contact details such as mobile and email
                addresses for students, allowing the tutor to easily contact students as
                needed.</para>

                <para>A College can set whether or they wish the Tutor to see the contact details of
                    the students via the Website CMS under the <guimenu>Site Settings</guimenu>
                    menu. Whether this information is displayed is dependent upon the individual
                    policies of Colleges and the management of student records. </para>

            <title>Approving Class Information</title>
            <para>Tutors can confirm their availability for a given Class using the Portal. To
                access any Classes that a Tutor has not yet confirmed their availability for, simply
                click on the <guimenu>To Confirm</guimenu> menu within the Portal. There is also a
                dialog box available to the tutor so they can send in comments and or suggested
                amendments to the course copy. College staff then approve and update the changes via
                the onCourse Client. Tutors cannot edit the course schedule or description
                themselves, since it needs to be properly approved by College staff.</para>
