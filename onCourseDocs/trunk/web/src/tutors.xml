    <title>Information for Tutors</title>
    <section>
        <title>Getting started</title>
        <para>The skillsOnCourse portal is a web site that gives you information you need without
            having to contact you regularly. "Is my class full?", "Will my class go ahead?", "Can I
            get a class roll". These are all things that your teaching staff will ask you every day;
            now you have a 24 hour assistance to help tutors get the answers they need.</para>
            <para>To view all they will be sent an email which allows them to log into
            skillsOnCourse and set their password. Tutors are also given an account when their
            record is created in onCourse.</para>
            <para>The skillsOnCourse login screen will prompt the student or tutor to enter their details.
                Like the onCourse enrolment process, a student is identified by name and email address
                to avoid forcing students and tutors to remember another user id.</para>

            <para>It is also possible to log into skills onCourse as a Company rather than an individual. To
                do so simply tick the <guilabel>As company</guilabel>box, then enter the email address
                and password for your Company.</para>

                <title>Recovering and Resetting Passwords</title>
                <para>The main login screen for the skillsOnCourse portal includes a 'forgot
                password' link. You will need your name and  email address in order to initiate the
                process. If you are not sure what these details are please contact the college so
                that they can manually update your record. </para>
                <para>When you click on the forgot password link after you have entered your
                details, an email will be sent to you with a link to allow you to create a new
                password. This link will be valid for 24 hours only, after that time the link within
                your email will not work. Once you have reset your password, they can continue using
                skillsOnCourse.</para>
                <para><programlisting>Dear {name},

To reset your SkillsOnCourse password, simply click the link below. That will take you to a web page
where you can create a new password. Please note that the link will expire 24 hours after
this email was sent.
				
  {recoveryLink}

If you weren't trying to reset your password, don't worry - your account is still secure and no
one has been given access to it. Most likely, someone just mistyped their email address
while trying to reset their own password.</programlisting></para>
