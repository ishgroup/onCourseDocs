        <para>The <link xlink:href="https://www.skillsoncourse.com.au/portal/login">skillsOnCourse
                portal</link> is a web site that gives you the information you need without having
            to contact the college regularly. "Is my class full?", "Will my class go ahead?", "Can I
            get a class roll". These are all things that the portal can help answer.</para>

                <title>Recovering and Resetting Passwords</title>
                <para>The main login screen for the skillsOnCourse portal includes a 'forgot
                password' link. You will need your name and  email address in order to initiate the
                process. If you are not sure what these details are please contact the college so
                that they can manually update your record. </para>
                <para>When you click on the forgot password link after you have entered your
                details, an email will be sent to you with a link to allow you to create a new
                password. This link will be valid for 24 hours only, after that time the link within
                your email will not work. Once you have reset your password, they can continue using
                skillsOnCourse.</para>
                <para><programlisting>Dear {name},

To reset your SkillsOnCourse password, simply click the link below. That will take you to a web page
where you can create a new password. Please note that the link will expire 24 hours after
this email was sent.
				
  {recoveryLink}

If you weren't trying to reset your password, don't worry - your account is still secure and no
one has been given access to it. Most likely, someone just mistyped their email address
while trying to reset their own password.</programlisting></para>
