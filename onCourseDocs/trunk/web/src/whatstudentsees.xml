	<title>Online Enrolments</title>
	<para>onCourse has a password free purchasing process meaning that students don't have to remember
		obscure student identification details from their last enrolment, like a student number or a
		password they may have created some time ago. onCourse does everything possible to move the
		student quickly and simply through the enrolment process to secure their payment and
		commitment to the enrolment. Forcing a student to remember a old password will result in
		some loss of sales as students give up in frustration.</para>
	<para>For this reason, onCourse errs on the side of sometimes creating duplicate student records
		rather than risking losing a sale. If you were running a banking website, then accurate
		identification might be critical. But here, we want to do everything to make it easy.</para>
	<para>Where a student has enrolled previously they are identified by their contact details and can move immediately to the payment
		process. No information they have previously provided is exposed during this process.</para>
	<section>
		<title>Matching the student</title>
		<para>After a student has added classes, products or applications to their shopping basket and
			proceeded to checkout, they will see the page below. All the student needs to enter here
			is their first name, last name and email address. Based on an exact match of these three
			fields, this determines if they are a new student or a returning student.</para>
		<para>Sometimes students will use a different name (through marriage or abbreviation).
			Sometimes they will change their email address. In these cases, onCourse will create a
			new student record which you might want to merge later.</para>

			<para>If this is the first time the person is interacting with your college, after they have

				onCourse. In the example below the only question which is mandatory is their
				postcode which is marked with a '*' symbol.</para>
			<para>If you have set a minimum age for enrolment, the date of birth will be mandatory. The Data

				text.</para>
			<para>If in onCourse, you allow concession details to be added online, there will also be a dropdown for the student to select from

		<title>Adding a Parent or Guardian</title>
		<para>Within the Editor settings you can specify an age under which all enrolments will require
			parent or guardian contact details e.g. for students under 18. In the example below,
			student Alicia Badgery, is trying to enrol in 'Course 22435' however since she is under
			18 years of age the following message appears at the bottom of the page 'We require the
			details of a parent of guardian for billing and emergency contact'. We recommend that
			you also make the date of birth field mandatory for your system.</para>
		<para>If the student has enrolled before, and already has a parent/guardian contact related to them in onCourse, then this information
			will not be requested and they can proceed to payment.</para>
		<para>Until these details are supplied, there is no option to proceed to the payment screen. Instead the button changes to say 'Add
			parent or guardian' and there is a new step at the top of the page called 'PARENT'. Clicking the button directs to the same initial
			'YOUR DETAILS' page where the parent or guardian contact details can be supplied. As per adding all other contacts, if their details
			are already in onCourse, then only a first name, last name and email address are needed to identify them.</para>

		<para>Once the guardian or parents details have been captured the 'PARENT' step will be removed from the top of the page. There will
			also be a message informing the student that since they are below 18 the parent or guardian that has been entered has been set as the
			payer. They can now proceed to payment page as normal.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Payment</title>
		<para>At the point of payment, the payer (person who will receive the invoice) can be selected. In the example of an enrolment with
			multiple students, the first contact added will be set as the payer by default. In the drop down list, you can select another
			payer.</para>
		<para>If the student is under 18, their parent/guardian will be set as the payer by default. This can be changed back to the student if
			required.</para>
		<para>For an enrolment to be successful, the payment section must be successfully completed. Credit card details are validated in real
			time and if the student abandons the transaction because they can not supply these details, you will see their enrolment in onCourse
			as 'failed', which you may choose to follow up. </para>
		<para>Once the student is on the 'PAYMENT' page there are two main ways to pay for their classes, these are:</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Pay using a credit or debit card (default)</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>Click on the 'CorporatePass' option. They can enter their CorporatePass code in the field to complete the transaction without
					the need for a payment at this time. This process works via pre-approval and it can't just be chosen by any visitor to the website
					(more information on this can be found in the <link xlink:href="#paymentoptions">payment options chapter</link>). </para>
				<para> </para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		<para>If the payer is listed below then all they have to do is make the radio button next to their
			name is marked before filling in their credit/debit card details. If the payer is not
			already listed then they can click on the 'Choose a different payer' button, select
			whether the payer is a person or business and then add them as a contact. If the payer
			is a business when trying to add them as a contact instead of the 'Your details' page
			asking for the first and last name of the contact, it will instead ask for the business
			name.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Confirmation</title>
		<para>After the student has clicked on the 'Confirm purchase' button at the bottom of the PAYMENT
			page, then they will be directed to a confirmation page with a message informing them
			that their online enrolment was either successful or rejected.</para>
		<para>If the student is paying by credit card, this is the point where their card details are verified with the bank as being correct
			and having sufficient funds available.</para>
		<para>At this point, onCourse also verifies there is still a place available in the class. If
			between the student commencing and completing the online enrolment process, the last
			place has been booked by another student, the enrolment process will fail at this point.
			Their credit card will not be billed. You will see the enrolment attempt and failure in
			onCourse, so you can follow them up if they don't successfully complete the
			enrolment.</para>

		</mediaobject>
		<para>If the enrolment and payment were successful, at the bottom of the page there will be a
			continue button. If you've created a post enrolment page in the configuration, they will
			be redirected there, if not they will be re-directed to the courses list page.</para>
		<para>If the students enrolment goes through successfully and their credit card is accepted they will see a page similar to the screen
			shot shown below.</para>

		</mediaobject>
		<para>If the credit card is not accepted the student will see a page similar to the screen shot shown below explaining what they may
			need to check or correct. At this point the student can try again or abandon their enrolment.</para>
		<para>Abandoned enrolments are shown as 'failed' enrolments in onCourse.</para>

		</mediaobject>
		<para>After a successful online enrolment process, the payer of the invoice will be emailed a tax invoice, and each of the successfully
			enrolled students will be emailed an enrolment confirmation. If the student is enrolling and paying for themselves, then they will
			receive both emails.</para>
		<para>These automatic emails are sent based on your customisable invoice and enrolment confirmation email templates in onCourse.</para>
