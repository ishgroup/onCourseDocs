    <title>What the student sees</title>
    <para>onCourse has a password free purchasing process meaning that students don't have to
        remember obscure student identification details from their last enrolment, like a student
        number or a password they may have created some time ago. </para>
    <para>Where a student has enrolled previously they are identified by their contact details and
        can move immediately to the payment process. No information they have previously provided is
        exposed during this process.</para>

        <title>Student Details</title>
        <para>After a student has selected which class/es they want to enrol in and clicked on the
            button 'PROCEED TO CHECKOUT' they will see the page below. All the student needs to
            enter here is their first name, last name and email address.  Based on an exact
            databased match of these three fields, this determines if they are a new student or a
            returning student.</para>

            <para>If the student enrolling in the class/es has already enrolled in a previous class,
                been added to a waitlist or had some other interaction with you (therefore their
                details are already stored in your database), after they have entered their first

                have entered their first name, last name and email address it will take them to the
                next details page where more information can be added. All the fields on this page
                can be shown or hidden, or made mandatory or optional within the CMS settings. As
                you can see below the only question that is mandatory is their postcode which is
                marked with a '*' symbol.</para>
            <para>If you have set a minimum age for enrolment in the CMS, the date of birth will be
                mandatory. If you have classes that have an age range requirement set, you should
                also choose to make the Date of Birth mandatory during online enrolment to enforce
                these rules.</para>
            <para>In the onCourse CMS, you can choose to show or hide the AVETMISS questions.  These
                questions can not be made mandatory as they are required to be optional responses
                from students undertaking vocational training.</para>
            <para>If in onCourse, you allow concession details to be added online, there will also
                be a dropdown for the student to select from the list whether they have any
                concessions you accept, and if you require concession card details or an expiry
                date, these fields will also show as mandatory.</para>

            <para>From August 2014, you can now include custom fields you've added to onCourse
                contact records into the online enrolment process. By default these will be hidden,
                but in the CMS you can choose to expose them. The 'Special needs' field is also
                available to show or hide, allowing you to collect additional text about the any
                dietary or medical considerations that make impact on training.</para>

                above the field where they can add a promotional code.</para>
            <para>If they click on it then it will take them back to the 'YOUR DETAILS' page
                allowing them to enter the additional students' details.</para>
            <para>To add another person, they need to know their first name, last name and email

        <para>* Price before and after discount of each class along with a total at the bottom right

            additional student' for more information)</para>
        <para>* A field to enter promotional codes, gift certificates or vouchers (more information

        <para>Once the student has read the summary of information and is happy with the details

    <section>
        <title>Adding a Parent or Guardian</title>
        <para>Within the CMS settings you can specify an age under which all enrolments will require
            parent or guardian contact details e.g. for students under 18. In the example below,
            student Alicia Badgery, is trying to enrol in 'Course 22435' however since she is under
            18 years of age the following message appears at the bottom of the page 'We require the
            details of a parent of guardian for billing and emergency contact.' </para>
        <para>If the student has enrolled before, and already has a parent/guardian contact related
            to them in onCourse, then this information won't be requested and they can proceed to
            payment.</para>
        <para>Until these details are supplied, there is no option to proceed to the payment screen.
            Instead the button changes to say 'Add parent or guardian' and there is a new step at
            the top of the page called 'PARENT'. Clicking the button directs to the same initial
            'YOUR DETAILS' page where the parent or guardian contact details can be supplied. As per
            adding all other contacts, if their details are already in onCourse, then only a first
            name,  last name and email address are needed to identify them.</para>

            </caption>
        </mediaobject>
        <para>Once the guardian or parents details have been captured the 'PARENT' step will be
            removed from the top of the page. There will also be a message informing the student
            that since they are below 18 the parent or guardian that has been entered has been set
            as the payer. They can now proceed to payment page as normal.</para>

    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Payment</title>
        <para>At the point of payment, the payer (person who will receive the invoice) can be
            selected. In the example of an enrolment with multiple students, the first contact added
            will be set as the payer by default. In the drop down list, you can select another
            payer.</para>
        <para>If the student is under 18, their parent/guardian will be set as the payer by default.
            This can be changed back to the student if required.</para>
        <para>For an enrolment to be successful, the payment section must be successfully completed.
            Credit card details are validated in real time and if the student abandons the
            transaction because they can not supply these details, you will see their enrolment in
            onCourse as 'failed', which you may choose to follow up. </para>
        <para>Once the student is on the 'PAYMENT' page there are two main ways to pay for their
            class/es, these are:</para>
        <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Pay using a credit or debit card (default)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Click on the 'CorporatePass' option. They can enter their CorporatePass code in
                    the field to complete the transaction without the need for a payment at this
                    time. This process works via pre-approval and it can't just be chosen by any
                    visitor to the website (more information on this can be found in the <link xlink:href="#paymentoptions">payment options chapter</link>). </para>
                <para> </para>

    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Confirmation</title>
        <para>After the student has clicked on the 'Confirmed purchase' button at the bottom of the
            PAYMENT page, then they will be directed to a confirmation page with a message informing
            them that their online enrolment was either successful or rejected.</para>
        <para>If the student is paying by credit card, this is the point where their card details
            are verified with the bank as being correct and having sufficient funds
            available.</para>
        <para>At this point, onCourse also verifies there is still a place available in the class.
            If between the student commencing and completing the online enrolment process, the last
            place has been booked by another student, the enrolment process will fail at this point.
            Their credit card will not be billed.</para>
