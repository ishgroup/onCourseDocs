= Release 0.6.1
29 Mar 2007


== Major features

* Waiting lists are now implemented. This is for students you cannot
offer a place to immediately but you want to keep track of their needs.
We still need to hook this into the web site, but for now we have
implemented the onCourse side of this.
* When the server starts up for the first time, you can now choose to
create a new data file with sample data included. This makes it easier
to people to begin testing onCourse.
* Speed improvements. We have threaded many parts of the user interface
drawing code so now much of it happens in parallel. This means that
windows will now open much more quickly and the application as a whole
is more responsive to mouse clicks and key presses.

== Minor features

* Financial transaction report (a list of transactions suitable for
opening in Excel)
* Better clarity in creating new students in the 'clairvoyance' data
entry within Quick Enrol. There is now a "create newâ€¦" option at the
bottom of the list of student choices.
* Multiple enrolments may now be refunded in one go rather than one at a
time as before
* Improved progress bars for tasks which take a long time (eg. printing,
duplicating classes, etc). Yes, it is only cosmetic, but it looks nice.
* Duplicating courses now gives better and clearer options to move the
classes forward a certain number of days, along with all included
sessions.
* More drag and drop events throughout the application, allowing you to
drag items from a list window (eg. a student or class) onto another
window (eg. the Quick Enrol window)
* Student message field extended from 50 characters to 500.
* Discount rounding (eg. to nearest dollar, 10 cents or 50 cents) is now
possible.
* Outcome list now shows the name of non-VET courses so that a user can
quickly see which course the outcome refers to when there is no AVTEMISS
module linked.
* Dates can now be entered in the format 010207 or 01022007, both of
which mean 01-02-2007.

== Fixes

Many GUI quirks have been cleaned up now, particular in clairvoyance
(type-ahead).

Windows users were not able to print if they did not have write
permissions to the location where the onCourse application was located.
We now save temporary print files to a better location.

The application did not prevent you from over-enrolling a class. It now
still allows you to do so, but gives you a warning. We will be looking
at whether we want to completely prevent this, or allow users to proceed
with a warning.
