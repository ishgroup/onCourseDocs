= Release 0.7
01 Jan 2008


== Major features

=== Content Management System (CMS)

This is for the building of a web site which surrounds the course and
enrolment pages. At the moment, colleges using our web enrolment systems
have a separate mechanism for updating 'static' content via ftp and
uploading files into a template. These pages might include special
offers, policies, contact us, etc.

With the new onCourse CMS, pages and menu structure can be built using
onCourse itself. Just like your courses and other information, these
pages automatically update the web site. What's more, some neat new
things will be possible:

* automatic generation of menus
* embedding dynamic content everywhere. This allows you to mix dynamic
content from courses, classes, sites, etc with 'static' pages. This
allows you to easily build special offer pages for instance.
* rich text display through our tagging markup syntax

=== Images and pdf attachment

With the introduction of these option, you can embed images and pdfs
everywhere â€“ this includes images on course pages, such as a tutor
photo, or pdfs attached to a course or other page.

=== Tagging

A 'tagging' concept for courses, classes, web pages and other content
allows you to build rich ways to navigate through your data. You may
wish to group all courses as part of a specific promotion and have that
grouping display as a list on your web site. Or you may wish to have a
purely internal classification of areas of responsibility for classes.
Think of this like categories and subcategories which extend as many
levels as you want and with much more flexibility, not just for the web
site but for your internal use as well.

=== Multi-currency support

Not everyone uses $, so we will extend the capabilities of the system to
allow for other currency symbols. This doesn't make onCourse exchange
rate aware, but allows it to operate outside of Australia.

=== Import

We are writing a generic import function which will bring in XML data
from other enrolment systems. The idea is that we then write specific
converter scripts for each program or data set we need to import which
plug into this generic import framework. We will be releasing the
documentation for this XML format so that others will also be able to
write their own converter scripts.

=== Indesign export

More than just a text export, this tight integration with this popular
layout program allows you to bring across courses, classes, tutor
information, categories and subcategories. At the same time they can be
automatically styled, ready for publication with only a few tweaks.
