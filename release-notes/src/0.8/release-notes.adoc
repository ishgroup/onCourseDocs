= Release 0.8



== Important changes

Because this is a major update, it is very important that you take a
backup before performing this upgrade. It will then take up to 10
minutes (on a slow server) to upgrade your data once you start the new
onCourse server before you are able to log in again.

== Major features

=== New Dashboard

We've added a new way to navigate around onCourse and learn about how
the various parts fit together.

=== Clairvoyance reworked

Clairvoyance (also called autocomplete or type-ahead) has been rewritten
from scratch and now allows for faster more streamlined searching on
students.

The search works by searching for a last name and then bring a list of
matches. You can search for somebody's full name by adding a space after
the last name.

ie. "Smith" by itself will be searching for all people with last name
"Smith". Typing "Smith J" will be searching for people with "Smith" as a
first name and last name starting with "J", and will bring a list of
matches.

=== Contacts

Students and tutors are now unified within the concept of contacts. This
now allows for contacts who are neither tutors nor students, and tutors
who are also students. Companies are also now supported, as are contacts
who might just be a lead or other contact and not a student.

=== Webpages and Subjects

Webpages and Subjects can now appear on your site in an order that you
decide with a weighting system. Lower weighted webpages sit higher than
heavier weighted pages. Webpages are much more flexible now and can be
assigned a short name which is used for menus and links.

=== Attachments

Images and other attachments have been enhanced in how they can be
linked to a web page or to a course. This makes it easier to attach a
pdf to a course displayed online for instance.

=== Concessions and promotional codes

More flexibility has been adding in allowing students of a certain age,
with discount cards or who have enrolled recently to be limited to
certain discounts.

=== Web site integration

Substantial work has taken place on how onCourse communicates with the
web site, making it even more reliable and faster. Updates to the web
site now run in the background every 5 minutes. Quick Enrol shows more
feedback about payments which succeed or fail and it provides more
choices about what to do with (say) a rejected credit card. The web site
rich text syntax has become more powerful, allowing randomly chosen
embedded images, linked pdfs, email forms and much more.

The onCourse web site itself now supports a host of new concepts:

* promotional codes may be accepted online
* student login to see past history and edit contact details
* tutor login to see upcoming classes and enrolment counts, as well as
editing contact details
* pretty urls (/about/contact rather than /tag?id=123)
* interactive calendars of courses and sessions
* email a friend
* reworked enrolment checkout process taking advantage of Web 2.0
concepts to make it easier and less confusing to add multiple students,
enrolments and (soon) other products

=== User interface

Although the major user interface improvements have been around
clairvoyance, other improvements have also been made: such as list views
can now have their columns resizes and moved around. These new sizes and
positions are saved for that user, along with the window position. Some
other work has been required for OSX 10.5 which caused some changes in
the layouts.

Sorting on multiple columns has been put in onCourse (hold down shift,
and click on another column). This allows a number of useful things, for
example: by surname, then by suburb.

=== Technology

Significant changes have taken place behind the scenes. Updates to the
database engine, a move to Java 5 and more minor updates to most
libraries we use to improve speed and reliability. Major enhancements to
the replication technology were also included at this time. We also
performed testing against Windows Vista.

=== Course search

Replaced "Course code" and "Class code" search. Functionality has now
been combined in the "Code" search. Searching on "begins with" will
search on the Course code. Searching with "ends with" will search on the
class code. Note: As an example "ARC134B-0023" is the full course-class
code where "ARC134B" is the course code, and "0023" is the class code.

=== Reports

We have enhanced and added new reports such as:

* Statement
* Class by Subject
* Class rolls
* Reconcile
* Banking
* Qualifications
* Enrolment confirmation
* Profit and Loss for classes, Profit and Loss for courses

=== Messaging

We've now included the ability to untick message recipients from a list
of contacts.

=== XML exporting

Significant enhancements to the Indesign and XML export.

== Reports and scripts

We have enhanced and added new reports such as:

* Statement
* Class by Subject
* Class rolls
* Reconcile
* Banking
* Qualifications
* Enrolment confirmation
* Profit and Loss for classes, Profit and Loss for courses
