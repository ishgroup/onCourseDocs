= Release 1.0.1

== Release 1.0.1

=== Important changes

Over the past month, we've been working on a number of issues that were
present in our 1.0 release. We strongly recommend that people update
both server and client to 1.0.1 to enjoy the improvements.

=== Major features

When using QE to enrol a student in a class that had only a single place
left, there was a bug that would not allow that last place to be
enrolled. This has been resolved and onCourse now correctly allows the
last place to be filled.

The quick search in the contacts list now allows correctly searching for
student first names by either using either "Smith, James" or "James
Smith" as originally intended.

A number of individual reports did not print correctly in 1.0. These now
print correctly.

=== Fixes

* Fixed the problem with counting places left in the QE, simplified the
code

allowing first names to be used again.
