= Release 1.0
01 Mar 2008


== Important changes

Because this is a major update, it is very important that you take a
backup before performing this upgrade. It will then take up to 10
minutes (on a slow server) to upgrade your data once you start the new
onCourse server before you are able to log in again.

== Major features

=== Access control

Want to lock certain users out of parts of onCourse? Now you can control
users' rights to almost every part of the application, down to 'view',
'edit', 'create', 'delete' and 'print' right levels. For SMS and email,
you can even control which users can send up to 50 messages and which
can blast your entire customer base with many more..

Access control sounds simple to describe, but it has been a big effort
to implement and test throughout the whole application.

=== Quick find in lists

It has always been possible to search for records in classes, tutors,
courses, rooms, and in fact in any list view within onCourse. That
search functionality is still there and even improved, but there is now
a quick way to search directly in the list view, select tagged items and
restore saved searches.

=== Quicker ways to view related records

We've added our goto icon image:images/link-rollover.png[] in more places
– as usual clicking on this will open up the related record in a new
window.

As an example, in the following image, if you click on on the
icon image:images/link-rollover.png[], this will
open the student record in a new window.

=== Tagging and Untagging more than one record at once

One of the features that was requested was a means to manage tags in
bulk, we've included this feature now in our latest release.

Assuming that you've already created some tags, highlight the records
that you'd like to tag and right click the tag on the left. This should
give you the option to either add the tag to the highlighted records or
remove the tag from the highlighted records.

=== Class budgets

Each class can be allocated a set of costs: fixed, per session, per hour
or per enrolment. This allows you to define costs such as room rental
per hour, materials costs per student and so on. You can also enter your
target enrolments, enter funding arrangements (eg. government
contributions) calculate minimum break-even, report on target vs actuals
over any period and produce budgets.

=== External backend database choices

MySQL, Microsoft SQL and Oracle are now additional choices for backend
database in addition to the existing built-in Derby engine. These new
choices allow the system to scale effectively to enterprise level
customers, allow for clustered databases and improve server speed,
reporting and backup options.

=== AQTF 2007 Competency Completion Quality Indicator export

A new AQTF requirement has been imposed on all RTOs in Australia.
onCourse is the first enrolment package to support this new export and
does it without requiring any additional work from you.

=== Flexible outcome creation

99% of the time, an accredited course is built in advance with a
qualification and the appropriate units of competency/modules linked.
But sometimes, the actual units taught can vary only after the class has
started when a tutor makes decisions based on the competencies of the
class. English as a Second Language (eg. CSWE) is often in this
category. In this case onCourse now allows for this flexibility, giving
you the option to create outcomes individually per enrolment. For
example, some students may complete one outcome, while others may engage
with, and complete more.

For managing various funding groups within the one class, such as state
funded, AMEP funded and overseas full fee paying students, it is now
also possible to modify the National Funding Source field per enrolment.
It will automatically be set to the default of the class, but can be
overridden as needed.

Start and end date and delivery mode can also be modified on a per
enrolment basis, so RPL outcomes can be assigned and the enrolment can
stay with the rest of the class group.

=== Nominal hours, classroom hours and Student Contact Hours

On the class window, there is a new tab called VET, which contains
fields that are useful for RTOs and relate to AVETMISS and other
delivery statistics. The three AVETMISS specific fields 'Delivery mode',
'funding source' and 'DET booking ID' have moved to this tab, from the
General tab. Additional fields regarding hours have been added.

*Qualification Hours* – These are the nominal hours set by NCVER for the
qualification. Often, this field is left blank, which is acceptable for
AVETMISS.

*Student Contact Hours* – This field multiplies the number of students
enrolled by the number of reportable hours. SCHs are often used by
funding bodies to measure delivery.

*Classroom Hours* – The total hours you have defined as scheduled
activity by setting sessions or by defining the minutes per sessions and
number of sessions on the General tab. This is not reported as part of
AVETMISS – it is for your information only.

*Nominal Hours* – The total nominal hours of the units of competency
assigned to the course. While the nominal hours are usually set by
NCVER, you can override them or add them where they are missing in
Module record.

*Reportable Hours* – These are the hours that will be reported against
each enrolment in the NAT00120 file. They default to the nominal hours
of the course. If there are no nominal hours as set by the module, i.e.
in a non-VET course, the nominal and reportable hours will default to
the classroom hours. You can override the reportable hours field to the
classroom hours or any other number that you wish to export in it's
place.

=== Custom Fields for Contacts

You can create custom fields for contacts which will be searchable. This
allows you to create fields for, and record information that is
particular to your business. Some examples of how this field may be used
are payroll numbers, licence numbers, student numbers that stay with the
student between training organisations and date of initial contact. You
can add as many additional fields as you need to contact.

=== Relationships for Contacts

You can define how contacts relate to each other, such as siblings,
spouse and parents and make contacts employees of companies. This is
especially useful for tutors who work as contractors and may have
separate business and personal contact details.
