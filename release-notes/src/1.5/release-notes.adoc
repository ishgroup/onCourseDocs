= Release 1.5
22 Oct 2008


== Major features

=== HTML emails

onCourse can now send multipart emails with plain and html parts. HTML
emails can be created in a tool of your choice and inserted into
outgoing messages.

=== Mailing lists

We've optimised the sending of mailing lists, and you should also
receive some visual progression so that you know that things are
happening as messages to large lists are being sent. Mailing lists have
been given greater prominence within the interface to make them easier
to use and search on. The web site allows students and potential
students to subscribe and unsubscribe to mailing lists.

=== Bounce processing

When outgoing emails or SMSs bounce more than a certain number of times,
the person has that contact method set as undeliverable. This happens
automatically as onCourse processes both the bounced emails and SMS
failure notifications.

=== SSL

Improvements to handling of SSL encryption between client and server to
allow the client to verify that it is connecting to the correct server
and no man-in-the-middle attack is being attempted.

=== Date picker

For all text fields which require a date, there is now a date picker.
This simplifies the process of selecting dates from a small popup
calendar widget.

=== Overview Calendar

From the session button on the splash screen, you can know view the
entire programmed sessions for your college for any given day, week or
month. You can also use the tag groups to select one or more subject or
other tags for example, the program manager for Arts can easily view all
the upcoming arts classes in a single overview.

=== Record bulk processing

Adding and removing tags in bulk as well as web-enabling classes in
bulk.

=== AVETMISS

Numerous AVETMISS improvements, reducing the time required to clean up
data for AVETMISS export toward that ultimate goal of zero. We are
pretty close in most places right now, mainly with the exception of
checking postcode validity.

== Minor features

=== Full change log

* Contact profile picture feature.
* Added ldap authorisation as well as authentication. Roles are given to
users when the log in from data in the LDAP data source.
* Prevented phantom changes to the invoice, causing the "there are
un-commited changes" dialog to show up
* Clean up the preference view layout.
* Changed label for concession name entry to avoid confusion
* Fixed sheet drawing issues – opening the sheet bigger than a frame
does not cause painting grief. now it is positioned in the centre.
* Fixed a bug where "Send Email" is truncated at the top of the
messaging window
* The database backup service is not available if the database backend
in not Derby (default database)
* Corrected behaviour on record cancelling (or pressing prev/next
button) where it was possible to save record without proper permissions
using "Keep Changes"
* Debtors and creditors report improved: added student id column, phone
fields made wider, alignment fixed
* Fixed button spacing on subrecord list
* Made the screen for adding discounts/promo codes to class more
comprehensible
* Allow searching fields in view on list view by default rather than
just last name which is more intuitive.
* UserListController shouldn't subclass TaggableListController as
SystemUser is not Taggable.
* Adjusted the minimum size of discount and promocode views, now they
both look good in sheet
* Fixed the link icon, now the implementation allows traversing through
the relationships (allowing to display the link on contact relation
table for example)
* Profit and loss for class report breaks down the totals per account.
* The sheet dialog size is fixed (the spacer between buttons was causing
the layout to blow up)
* Reducing number of times contacts (and their relations) are validated.
* Optimisations: These two together significantly reduce the time lag
for QuickEnrol.
** queries by utilising local_cache for non-shared contexts.
** validation calls are reduced by having objects register themselves
for validation (and thus if already validated for the ValidationResult
not doing so again).
* Because this code is called so often (7500 times just to press tab in
QE), the logger debugs are taking all of 500ms combined. We don't really
need them in production code since the logs they create are a bit
overwhelming.
* Performance improvement for tag validation.
* Fixed typo in the reconcile screen
* Re-added room combobox to the session create dialog
* Removed double call to the validation on selecting contact with
clairvoyance on QE
* Fixed exception when creating session in Course view (the automatic
assignment of tutors wont work, since a course does not have relation to
tutors)
* Using common lock for graph-related methods in order to safeguard from
deadlocks.
* Reducing validation for CVV. It should only provide a warning which
should not prevent saving of the payment.
* Frame disposal is posted to the event dispatch thread, this way a
collision between two threads (one closing frame one refreshing etc) is
avoided.
* Don't log user passwords when debugging is set to full
* Fixed the problem with preference view, the ldap server port
preference is an integer.
* Login: the password is sent as encrypted already, no need to
re-encrypt it again on server.
* Refactor the security filter. This resolves some earlier LDAP issues
and also simplifies all the code considerably.
* Fixed sizing of dialogs, some information was not visible.
* The payment view in sheet could not be closed, now behaves correctly.
* Two data upgrades, one fixing a typo in the contact relation table,
second setting the default values for ldap
* Enabling/disabling widgets on the ldap preference tab. Friendly
message when ldap licence is off and user tries to enable it.
* Email from should never be different from reply to email address (for
messages sent from onCourse)
* Fix problem with posix style LDAP accounts.
* Fixed course class tutor report, was broken after the change in schema
which allowed linking many tutors to a class/session.
* Improved speed of sending emails by batching the process
* Improved user experience of sending emails by providing visual
feedback on progress
* Improvement in session drawing time by not displaying tutor
information
* Improvement in session colour coding for sessions when grouped by
course and displaying over 500 sessions
* Removed extended info on the session blob in calendar, trade-off for
faster calendar drawing
* Added "core filter" to the session list
* Fixed issue where the copy/cut/paste menu items did not work on
windows.

cause toolbar window to go away.
* Payment status is set to success when the payment gateway is not
contacted.

inside of it.

the problem with web proxy preventing connecting to server.

website.

with sheet becoming transparent when window looses focus, and also
avoids the flickering effect.

happens at random when disposing sheet.

file.

export the attached site.

instance. Also setting payment testing to true for run targets

conjunction with preference for reducing the visible qualifications to
offered only.

* Fixed class cast exception in automatic logout time

it more resilient and the code is now MUCH smaller and simpler to
follow.

color.

* the data upgrade is now less automatic, more manual but allows better
control over the order of the data updates.
