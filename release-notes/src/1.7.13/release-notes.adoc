= Release 1.7.13
17 Sep 2009


== Fixes

* Fixed a problem with downloading AVETMISS related modules, and
qualifications where the records downloaded would reach a certain number
and refuse to download more.
* Fixed a number of server shutdown issues
** for Windows: the window would go away but it required opening up Task
Manager to actually quit the onCourseServer.exe process
** for Mac OS X: the server window would not go away and requires a
Force Quit in order to quit onCourseServer
* Fixed a rare bug in QE where setting the discount value manually in
the class selection pane equal to the total value of enrolments would
credit the payer 10% of the total when the enrolment was saved.
* Fixed a problem when trying to import XML import files.
* Fixed not being able to share saved finds.
* Enrolment confirmations now correctly display all lines in the address
block, instead of just the first line.

=== Known Issues

==== Problem saving a session

If you:

[arabic]
. add a new tutor to an existing class which already has sessions,
. tick the "Add the selected new tutor to class sessions" check box
. without saving the class, edit an existing session and tick the tutor
you added in step 1

then, you will not be able to save the class.

The workaround is to save the class after step 2.

==== Saved find

Deleting a saved find does not refresh until a new list window is
opened.
