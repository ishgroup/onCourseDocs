= Release 1.7.14
01 Jan 2010


== Minor features

Re-enables the ability to define via a checkbox whether a discount is
automatically applied to users via Quick Enrol. Previously discounts
were always automatically applied if the student was eligible to receive
that discount.

== Fixes

* Fixes a bug where the tag assignments could be relinked to refer to
the tag group (e.g., Subjects) if redefining the tag definition.
* Fixes the export of xml for class prices over $999 (removing comma
separators)
* Fixes mysql binary data storage definitions to allow attachments over
32kB.
* Fixes a problem where message sending could send multiple emails to
some contacts when one or more of the contacts on the list had invalid
data. Emails are now sent and tracked individually.
* Fixes a server-side problem where refunds could fail (the banks would
sometimes reuse their tracking numbers).
* Fixes the contact list view tag filtering for 'Currently enrolled' and
'Currently teaching'
* Fixes a problem where the quit button in the login window didn't quit
the application.
* Extensive improvements to the AVETMISS export for State specific
export formats in NSW, QLD, Tasmania and (almost) Victoria. You can now
export AVETMISS for specific classes in any of these formats.
