= Release 1.7.21
01 Sep 2010


== The Bug Fix

We resolved a bug where failed and declined payments in and payments out
were being recorded against the Trade Debtors account (by default code
11500) and cheque account (default: 11100)

* Incorrect transactions are removed when onCourse is upgraded to
1.7.21.
* The amount owing on invoices is not affected by this bug.

== What does this affect?

On the Profit and Loss report, the Trade Debtors and Cheque account
values would have been incorrect if there were Failed or Declined
payments. This situation is only possible for customers using the
onCourse credit card gateway.

== Who should upgrade?

All customers who use onCourse payment gateway services.

Upgrade Duration - For customers with large amounts of data (if your
database folder is 2GB or larger in size), the upgrade may potentially
take an hour or more. during this time, no clients will be able to
login. Once the progress twirler, on the onCourse Server interface, has
stopped, clients will be able to connect again. We recommend that the
upgrade be done out of hours.

== Known issues

* Merging does not currently work. It gives an error message: The
merging process failed to initialise, please report the problem to
developers.
