= Release 1.7.4
24 May 2009


== Fixes

* Our calendaring plugin is the only closed source library we use and an
unfortunate error with the license keys has caused it to expire on
midnight of 24 May 2009. This problem is now resolved and an automated
test implemented in our system to ensure this cannot happen again. At
ish we tend to avoid closed source libraries whenever possible for
exactly this reason: we were eventually able to diagnose the problem by
decompiling the library and discovering exactly what it was doing,
something that is far easier when dealing with open source code
libraries. On the other hand, this calendaring plugin is very reliable
and gives us the gorgeous interface you see in the calendaring parts of
onCourse.
* Fixed a bug where stepping through a list of elements in clairvoyance
would lose the highlight on the typed text
* Don't highlight a class when the class is full in QE
* Fix problem which prevented the removal of concession card types
related to discounts for the web site
* Fix population of invoice line amounts from web site when a discount
was applied. The amount would be out by the value of tax on the
concession. This only applies to web payments.
