== Major features

=== Private Booking

This function allows users within the Quick Enrol screen to create a
custom class with a room, tutor and cost assigned and then enrol one or
more students. You could use this feature to create a private class for
a corporate client, to deliver a personalised training program to an
individual or small group, or to create a 1-on-1 coaching session. The
class can have one or more sessions, with the maximum enrolment set to
the number of student(s) you enrol at the time of creation. Once
scheduled, the class will be recorded within the database just like your
other classes, with enrolments created and entries in the timetables for
your students, room and tutors recorded.

=== Scheduling collision detection for resources

Double booked rooms and tutors have warning icons appear next to them on
the Calendar view. You can drag and drop the session within the calendar
to a different time, that doesn't conflict with another booking. or you
can keep the session double booked, for example if you want to purposely
book two classes into a room in case one is cancelled. Along with the
Private Booking feature, this would greatly suit our users who often
arrange small private sessions.

=== Improved relationship options in Quick Enrol

When using Quick Enrol there are a number of options available to take
advantage of relationships.

You can set a relationship between contacts and the payer of the
enrolment at the time of enrolment. This is useful when enrolling
friends together or a when a parent pays for a child's tuition.

If existing relationships have already been set for contacts, we take
advantage of this when adding contacts in Quick Enrol.

As example if you add a contact that is a parent, the child(ren) will
appear as an option when clicking on the "+" icon when choosing to add
an additional contact.

=== Increased speed over the internet

We have optimised the communication between client and server to much it
much faster over slow links (eg. when using onCourse over an internet
link). This, combined with our SSL encryption of the channel, makes
onCourse very usable across multiple sites and even wireless links.

=== XML Export

Throughout almost all list views in onCourse a new export feature allows
the user to export raw XML data, or data transformed into a wide range
of possible options. Because we chose the XSLT technology as a way of
transforming the export data, users are able to write their own
transforms. You can use an XSL stylesheet to export data as pdf, Word,
csv, tab delimited or almost any other data format you can imagine.

=== Server configuration file

Allows some useful parameters to be specified for the server such as
database location, IP address(es) and ports to listen on. This file will
allow onCourse to be more easily customised for those who have unusual
requirements on their network when the usual onCourse defaults don't
quite fit.

Our service installer will now detect the location of the configuration
file and not prompt for a database location.

=== Refunds

Refund credit cards though payment gateway, making it much easier to
cancel classes and refund students without having to phone the student
to get their card details.
