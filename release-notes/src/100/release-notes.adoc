= Release 100
28 Sep. 2021


== Major features
=== Website setup
A new navigation option is now available from the dashboard: "Website setup". Right now this allows you to create additional websites and change the domain names attached to them. In the future you'll be able to configure your analytics and much more.

Note that changes here will take a few minutes to have effect. Updates have to be made to all the load balancers and new certificates generated for your domains.

== Fixes
* Tag pencil should be hidden until hover `OD-16545`
* Messaging not showing any recipients from class list `OD-16548`
