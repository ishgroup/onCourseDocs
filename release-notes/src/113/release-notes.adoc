= Release 113
19 Mar. 2022

== Major features

=== New navigation

The primary navigation has been reworked to add more explanatory text for each option and group them in categories. The goal is to make onCourse more discoverable for new users and to showcase the different functionality it makes available.

=== New automation view

All the automation windows have been updated with a new more informative view. Gone is the clutter of a thousand scripts in the left sidebar and instead there is a new library style view with descriptions of the actions you might like to add.

Install any number of automations from the library, and then enable or disable them as you please.

=== Set up tutorial for new systems
