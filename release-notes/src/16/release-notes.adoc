= Release 16
17 Feb 2020


== Important changes and updates

=== AVETMISS data no longer inherits

Class, Enrolment and Outcome AVETMISS fields no longer inherit values.
For example, 'funding source state' could be entered in the Class and if
you didn't override that field in the Enrolment or in the Outcome, the
Class value would be used. The value would display with a padlock to
show the value that was used came from the Class.

Now in release 16, this doesn't happen. Instead, when you create an
Enrolment or an Outcome, the value is copied from the Class, rather than
inherited. This happens once so that if you then change the value in the
Class, the Enrolments and Outcomes that already exist are not updated,
but new enrolments and outcomes will reflect the change. We made this
change since it causes less confusion for new users.

It is important to note that this change means that changes to the class
timetable after enrolments are created will not automatically update the
start and end dates for outcomes.

=== Old AVETMISS export gone

The old AVETMISS export window had a number of bugs and has now been
completely removed. There is nothing you could do in the old window that
you cannot do in the new.

=== Dashboard search

The search panel on the dashboard has been moved to the left and is now
collapsible. Given that we're moving to a browser-based application
later in 2020, we needed to re-think our approach to navigation as it
won't be possible to use the standard navigation menus like we do in the
current java version of onCourse. This small but noticeable addition is
the first step towards introducing this change.

=== Missing features

In version 16 there are some features missing from the new Class user
interface. They will be returned in version 17. In the meantime you can
