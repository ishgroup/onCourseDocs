= Release 17

== Release 17

=== Important changes

The old user interface has now been removed for certificates, discounts
and payslips. The new screens have been in production for several
releases now, with no reported issues. Removing the old user interface
allows us to move forward with improved functionality without having to
maintain legacy screens.

=== Major features

==== Bulk edit

The new user interface has allowed us to give you an important new
feature: bulk edit. Today this is available in just class, course and
session views via the cogwheel for some of the more common attributes
you'll want to update in bulk. Further attributes will be added, so let
us know which ones you'd like to see.

==== Message templates

Sending messages manually to contacts now uses styled templates. This
means that not only are all your automated emails styled, but so too are
any messages you send by hand. Create templates for all sorts of common
messages, like 'Tutor sick' emails and SMS.

==== Timetable bulk editing

A new user interface to allow you to update the timetable in bulk. Move
sessions, adjust tutors, change rooms and more, even if your timetable
has hundreds of sessions.

==== 

===== Copy to clipboard

To make it easier to export small bits of data from onCourse as part of
your daily work, onCourse can now export directly to the clipboard. Use
the 'share' feature as normal, but select "copy to clipboard" once
you've chosen the export format. Typically one of the Excel formats is
what you want.

You can even create your own formats, so you could copy a class and get
an entirely formatted message block including URLs and any other data
you can imagine.

===== Collision detection

Collision detection is back and better than ever. It is faster and still
detects any collisions between tutor and room timetables as well as
unavailability rules.
