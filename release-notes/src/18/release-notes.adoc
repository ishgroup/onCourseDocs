= Release 18
7 Apr 2020


== Important changes

When viewing an outcome in detail view, you'll now see a list of any
associated AVETMISS uploads the outcome is attached to. You'll see the
date the export was run, who it was run by and the status of the
outcome.

You can now log in with your email address. The old username also works,
but email address is preferred and is what people expect from
applications these days. Check that your email address is properly
configured in security settings.

== Major features

The following windows have been migrated to the new user interface:

* Documents
* Assessments
* Change password

For users of onCourse in a web browser, we've improved the way the back
and forward buttons on work without losing any search or filtering
information. This also means you've be able to save windows as bookmarks
in your browser and to share those links with colleagues. When creating
support tickets with ish, please send us the URL of the window you are
looking at.
