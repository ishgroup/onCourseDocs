= Release 2.0.2
13 Jan 2011


== Fixes

* Massive performance improvement inside the Quick Enrol window,
particularly with regard to autocomplete.
* Fixed code which prevented creating new students/certificates or
invoices in a blank new database
* Don't export qualification to the 030 AVETMISS if the outcome has no
module (it is a pretend course)
* Export 81 if course has no modules, not if it just isn't VET flagged.
* Export the admin site if we used it in the 120 file, even if that was
just used as a default site
* Don't export 130 AVETMISS file records if any of the outcomes for the
enrolment are past the export end date
* Don't export certificates which are revoked or deleted in the 130 file
