09 Feb 2012


== Fixes

* During NAT20 export the default country code was wrong, now correctly
showing Australia. This only affected sites which did not have an
explicit country set.
* Significant improvements to the synchronisation of data between
website and onCourse including attendances and outcomes, contact phone
numbers and postcodes, notes field for waiting lists and more.
* Preventing rare scenario where contact and/or student record could be
duplicated when synchronising data to the website
* Wide range of improvements to the synchronisation of enrolment data
with the website. Fixed issues with enrolments not updating their 'in
transaction' status
* Refunding enrolment after entering wrong credit card details could
lead to application freeze.
* Enrolments not linked to any invoice are now correctly opening in edit
view
* Fixed an issue upgrading onCourse 1.7 to 2.1.11 when using a MS-SQL
database and particular types of data
* Minor formatting and display fixes in cancelled classes printed report
* While compiling a new printed report possible error messages shown are
more meaningful to the user
