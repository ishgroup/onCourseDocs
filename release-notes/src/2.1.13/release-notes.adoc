= Release 2.1.13

== Release 2.1.13

=== Fixes

This is a minor bug fix release which has only one change in it. We
upgraded the jetty server library to 7.6.3 to order to avoid some issues
with serving SSL connections. The problem manifested very rarely and if
you aren't having trouble with the server stopping unexpectedly, then
you will get no benefit from this release.
