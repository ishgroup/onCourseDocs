== Fixes

where an intermittent fault was previously delaying record changes e.g.
changes to class descriptions

=== Minor fixes

* Fixed advanced search 'Not tagged with' option and 'tagged with'
option
* Corrected error in Quick Enrol that prevented a company from being
assigned as payer
* Fixed issues with saving email address in the preferences
* Corrected error in Quick Enrol where membership discounts were not
automatically applied
* Fixed ability to create $0 payment records
* Improved display of the QE list of results when many records are
displayed (stops list resizing where text becomes small)
* Allow the creation of sample databases where an onCourse.iocdata file
already exists

=== Notes

* Advanced search 'tagged with (or parent of this tag)' and 'not tagged
with (or parent of this tag)' still requires further fixes
