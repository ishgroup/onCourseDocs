= Release 2.1.9
02 Dec 2011


== Fixes

* Failed and 'in transaction' enrolments should not be able to be
refunded.
* Setting 'is Offered' and 'reportable hours' for qualifications would
sometimes be reset
* Sending lots of tags to the website at once sometimes did not work.
* Mailing lists were not updating on the website
* A successful enrolment/payment could sometimes report as failed in
onCourse.
* Display of class budgeted income, was not accounting for some costs
* Upgrading onCourse from 1.7 version to 2.1.8 might fail due to some
data upgrades.
* Attendance would sometimes fail to update on the website, meaning that
the skillsOnCourse portal would be missing some students in the class
roll.
* Some outcome records would not update on the website
* Preferences window layout was visually ugly when credit card payments
are enabled
* Rolling over a class potentially resulted in start/end dates one day
out for 2012, due to improper handling of daylight savings and leap
year.
* Reduced memory usage for some data upgrades
* Enrolment last modification timestamp was not recorded properly in the
database.
* Changing Courses and Classes subject tags did not apply correctly to
the website
