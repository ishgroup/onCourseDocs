= Release 26



== Important changes

Note that the onCourse client application and jnlp application are going
away after the next release. Make sure you are logging in with a URL
like https://acme.cloud.oncourse.cc

== Major features

We've added a new Batch Payments feature to onCourse. This is a brand
new screen that will show you a list of contacts with saved credit card
data and unpaid invoices where the due date is in the past. You can run
the batch payment and the system will attempt to process each payment
one by one. You'll be shown each successful and each failed transaction
as they're processed, and each successful payment will trigger a payment
successful email to the contact.
