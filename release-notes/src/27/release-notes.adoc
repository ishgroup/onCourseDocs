= Release 27

== Release 27

=== Important changes

This is the first release of onCourse with no Java client application.
Only the web client is supported from here on.

=== Major features

==== Imports

A new major feature, imports are a special kind of script which can take
one or more files as inputs, usually to create records inside onCourse.
This might be useful to migrate from another system or just run period
data imports.

==== Three column resize

The right column in three column view is now resizable. This gives you a
lot of flexibility to match onCourse to your screen size and use
patterns.
