== Important changes

Please note that the upgrade from a previous version may take a little
while; larger databases could take 10-15 minutes to upgrade. Please
don't stop the upgrade while it is in progress.

== Major features

=== User interface improvements

* Remove empty tutor wage record from budget when class is duplicated
and "assign the same tutors.." option is not selected
* Improvement to the visual layout of the Quick Enrol window to ensure
the delete record icon doesn't get hidden behind the scroll bar

* After removing the entire class timetable, the class start and end
dates would be retained. Now they are removed.

=== Report improvements

* Sales Report fixed to print all records on a single page
* The class CSV export has been fixed to only count active enrolments

every page, the contact reference name for every invoice and payment in
record and correct the page by page account totals to always show the

transactions to the COS Discounts given account
* Added new Transaction CSV and XML export options
* Fixed Discounts by Class and Total Discount reports to exclude GST for
discount fee income reported

=== Transaction record improvements

* Display the deferred income journal method in cases where the college
had not explicitly chosen a setting. If you have not selected a Post
prepaid fees option in the financial preferences, the applicable income
for each class will be posted every session to your chosen income
accounts. See the Deferred Income chapter in the user manual.
* Fix to transaction record details to balance GL transaction account
debits and credits where default account options had not been selected
by the college
* Invoice transactions in the general ledger would sometimes be posted
at midnight instead of the correct time of day
* Added server start up trigger to transfer pre-paid fees in advance
liability to the designated income account, for college who shut down
their server overnight. The standard process is for this job to run at
12.30am.

=== Tagging improvements

* Improvements to tagging and filter results when multiple entity types
are tagged with the same tag
* Removed advanced search options "Not tagged with" and "Not tagged with
(or parent of this tag)" and added "tagged with (including children)" as
part of the re-factoring to tag filters and searches to improve the
return of accurate cross table results
* Improvement to the filter user interface in the sidebar options of
every window. Now tag filter groups can be collapsed and hidden from
view.
* New feature: Tag groups for courses and classes are shown twice as
filter options in the contact window, once for filtering students
enrolled in, and a second time to filter for tutors teaching classes
that are tagged with that tag option.
* Show tag long name inside onCourse user interface list views. Only use
short name for URL generation.
