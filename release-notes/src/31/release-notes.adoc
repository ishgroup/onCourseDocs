== Major features

We're introducing Funding Invoices, a new feature that will help you to
track any monies owed to you via additional funding, separately from the
student invoice. For single enrolments where the class has a funding
contract (that isn't fee for service), an additional window is now
available in the Checkout called Funding invoice. Set the provider
contact, set the purchasing contract ID, set the amount you're expecting
to receive in funding, and then set the expected payment dates.

Of course, if you don't want to use this feature, simply flick the
switch at the top of the window and it will go away, allowing you to
move on to accepting the student payment.

These invoices are created in onCourse and not sent to the contact, as a
way for you to track your funded payments internally.
