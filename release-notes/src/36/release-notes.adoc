== Major features

=== ASQA audit delivery reports

ASQA requires RTOs to produce customised spreadsheets before an audit,
similar to but different to the AVTEMISS exports. To save you time
converting your existing exports to ASQA requirements we've produced a
set of reports you can use for this purpose.

=== Bulk tagging and tagging

A new add/remove tag UI comes along with a way to use "bulk edit" from
the cog wheel to apply tags to lots of records at once. Be careful,
there is no undo!
