= Release 37
18 Aug 2020


== Important changes

We recently informed all onCourse users via an update on the onCourse
dashboard that we would be periodically updating scripts in the system
with newer versions of these scripts. This work is now completed in
version 37, so you'll notice in your system now several 'new' scripts.
If you had the default scripts turned off in your system, then the old
ones have been simply updated with the new ones, and there's nothing for
you to do. if you had any default scripts turned on and they hadn't had
their name changed from their default name, these will now appear with
the word 'old' in the title. This denotes that you are still using an
old script.

The newer scripts are much more user-friendly in that they allow all
users the ability to edit the variables within the script. These
variables change per script, but typically they are used to set the
message templates referenced by the script. This, as well as
re-factoring the script code to make them run more efficiently, was the
main goal of these script changes.

We've also implemented some nice new usability features like the drag
and drop UI for uploading new documents to onCourse.
