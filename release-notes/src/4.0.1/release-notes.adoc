= Release 4.0.1
25 Mar 2013


== Important changes

This release is only relevant to users reporting to Queensland
Department of Education

== Reports and scripts

Ensure that students enrolled in module only enrolments are reported as
enrolling and working towards a qualification (note for non QLD users,
the opposite applies in other states â€“ module only enrolments report
with no links to a parent qualification, as the student has not
indicated their intent to enrol in, and complete, a full qualification).

Note that this does not comply with Queensland Department of Education's
own published guidelines, however they insist on this reporting change.
