== Release 4.1.3

=== Important changes

This release includes fixes for AVETMISS 6.1 reporting. It is
recommended for all onCourse users preparing end of year AVETMISS
reports as it will reduce the error rate during validation.

=== Fixes

* Improve calculation of delivery site information, so all virtual sites
report the head office/admin site as their training location
* Remove possible duplicate entries in the NAT00020 file
* Fix a display issue in the Financial Preferences window which prevents
the first three choices from being selectable
* Fix an issue where certificates that create a record in the NAT00130
file would sometimes not create a corresponding record in the NAT0030
file.
