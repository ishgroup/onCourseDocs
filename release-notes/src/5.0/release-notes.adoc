= Release 5.0
16 Apr 2014


== Major features

=== Quick Enrol user interface

Months in the making, a sophisticated new design for Quick Enrol has
been built so your staff can process enrolments, sell products, create
invoices and record payments at lightning speed.

Some of the improvements include:

* Improved contact look-up selection: See a full list of possible
contact matches, with more data shown
* Simpler class and product selection: search, show all, or choose for
the quick list of recently sold items
* Sell products and vouchers: Two new types of products, which can be
bought along with the existing enrolment and memberships
* More flexible invoicing: easily add custom invoice lines on the fly,
and set the invoice due date into the future
* Your choice of payment delegation: Manually select which historical
invoices you wish the payment to apply to, or use our auto-calculate
feature to disperse the value of this payment against the invoices
outstanding
* Redeem vouchers for payment: a new feature for this release, allowing
vouchers to be redeemed during Quick Enrol
* Choice of confirmation method: after enrolment, send emails, print
confirmations or both

=== Vouchers

Vouchers are a new way to sell training to your customers. Vouchers can
be used in the traditional sense of a gift voucher, where the price of
purchase is the dollar value available for redemption, for example, a
voucher bought for $120 can be redeemed for $120 worth of training or
product. In addition, a voucher can be sold for a different value to
it's redemption value, for example, you can sell for $90 a voucher with
can be redeemed for $100, or give away free $20 gift vouchers as part of
a promotion you are running.

But more exciting than traditional style gift vouchers is the new
concept of vouchers as a way to bundle together the purchase of a group
of enrolments at a special price. For example, if you want to sell a
qualification as both a series of short courses and a full
qualification, you can bundle together the short courses and sell the
qualification as a voucher. The voucher will entitle the student to an
enrolment in each of the short courses.

Another way to use a voucher could be to sell one to a company for 20
enrolments in a particular course, as they know they have 20 staff they
wish to send along over the course of the year. As the staff enrol, they
redeem an enrolment from the voucher one by one, giving them the freedom
of selecting an advertised class from your schedule that fits around
their commitments (but not the freedom to use the voucher to enrol in
any other type of course). Or perhaps they all enrol in a custom class
you have created just for them, but are responsible for completing the
online enrolment process and filling out their contact details and
AVETMISS responses, so you don't need to do the data entry from paper
forms.

Each voucher has a unique identifying code and an expiry period (set by
you) and can be used in multiple transactions until it's total value has
been redeemed or it has expired. Vouchers can also been locked to send
the redemption invoice to a nominated individual and can be edited to
change the 'invoice to' and expiry date after sale.

A new chapter in the user handbook is available.

=== Products

Products, like textbooks, mugs, Certificate re-prints, and other fixed
charge items can now be created in onCourse and sold during the
enrolment process in the office or online.

See the user handbook for more information.

=== Selling memberships

Memberships can now be sold during the online enrolment process, along
with products and vouchers.

== Minor features

=== Western Australia specific reporting

The West Australian RAPT and CQR exports are now implemented.

Additional WA only options have been added to the class delivery mode
options, enrolment concession options and outcome status options to meet
this requirement.

The RAPT export format is available in the list of AVETMISS 7 options in
the File > Import/Export window, class cogwheel or enrolment cogwheel.

The CQR export format is available from the Certificate list cogwheel.

=== VET FEE HELP

The first round of User Interface features for VET FEE HELP
functionality has been added to onCourse. In the student AVETMISS
record, class VET tab, and enrolment FEE-HELP tab additional fields have
be added to record information that relates to VET FEE HELP reporting.

In following versions of onCourse, HEPCAT and CHESSN integration will be
added.

=== Performance

In this release we continue our work on improving performance over slow
networks. A high speed NBN may now never happen, so every bit helps. In
particular we compress network streams to get a 30% reduction (roughly)
in bandwidth needed. There is a new option in onCourse.cfg to tweak the
compression setting.

We have also moved the AVETMISS reporting system onto the server, so
performance of this export will be dramatically improved (in some cases
by a factor of 10).

== Fixes

=== Quick Enrol

* Improvement to contact name clairvoyant look up to improve search
behaviour on company names
* Allow new concessions to be added to existing contacts in Quick Enrol

=== Messaging

* Improvement to the send message window, to allow contacts to be
manually added to or deleted from the send list

=== Contacts

* New attachment types: tutors only, and tutors and enrolled students
for attachments available via the onCourse portals
* Fix to ensure attachments linked to contacts can be opened and viewed
from within the contact window

=== Discounts

* Improvements to the membership discount relationship window to allow
relationships to be edited and viewed
* Allow classes to be added and deleted to the discount classes tab in a
single action (previously, a record save was required between add and
delete actions)

=== Course and class records

* Increased the field length for the course code from 10 to 32
characters. The course code creates the default URL for a course e.g.
www.sttrinians.com.au/course/BCFS. With up to 32 characters now
available you can create more SEO relevant URLs e.g.
www.sttrinians.com.au/course/computerclassseniors
* Fix to the display of the class attendance tab, where the final
student's sessions sometimes couldn't be edited as they were hidden
under the scroll bar
* Fix to the timetable repeating session function so repeating every 2
or 3 days each week, skipping weekends, recreates the first session on
the same day of the week as the original session
* Improvement to class timetable sessions to allow session times of less
than 15 minutes
* Corrected an error in the onCourse calendar tool that in a mySQL
database sometimes incorrectly rounded the session time to a few minutes
past the selected time
* Ensure self-paced cancelled classes are included in the cancelled
classes filter

=== AVETMISS

* Improvement to AVETMISS to better comply with the new or continuing
enrolment specifications in the NAT000120. When the course is marked as
a full qualification, and the enrolment commenced before the 'outcomes
after' date specified when running the AVETMISS export, then the value
'4 – continuing enrolment in the qualification or course from a previous
year' is exported. When the course is marked as a full qualification and
the enrolment commenced after the 'outcomes after' date then the value
'3 – commencing enrolment in the qualification or course' is exported.
For all other enrolments, where the course is not marked as a full
qualification, the value '8 – units of competency or module only
enrolment' is exported. This fix is for both AVETMISS 6.1 & 7.
* Fix to the NSW DET version of the AVETMISS 7 export to change the fill
character for the Booking ID and Course Site ID are zeros instead of
spaces.
* Change to the AVETMISS 7 export to export all non-VET courses with an
ISH123 or similar code, to prevent code duplication errors now onCourse
allows 32 characters in this field, and AVETMISS allows only 12.
* Update to the NSW DET Export to meet the March 2014 ePayments Data
Extract File Technical Specifications. Changes include always including
a qualification reference in the NAT00120 record, even for a short
course and recalculating the NAT00130 export to export "Y" to indicate
that training in the full qualification was completed successfully but
"N" to indicate that the training was successfully completed in a
partial qualification, or unsuccessfully completed for a full or partial
qualification; or not completed in all UoCs enrolled.

=== Finance

* Improvement to the payslips 'add custom line' process to allow a
description
* Added payroll reference number to the payslip list view and made the
contact name column in the payslip window sortable
* Credit notes which automatically contra pay invoices, contra the
originating invoice in the first instance, an improvement from
defaulting to the oldest unpaid invoice
* Ensure automatically reversed web payments for failed enrolment
attempts reverse the originating income account, instead of the default
income account
* Add 'reverse payment' cog wheel feature to the payment in window

=== Email templates

* 'Invoice due date' and 'Customer reference number' now an available
field to insert into the email template for the Tax Invoice
* A new XML email template has been added to send the voucher code and
redemption information on purchase

=== Reports

* Change record sorting for Class Contact List to be alphabetical
* Sort order for invoice lines now grouped by class code
* Invoice report now grouped into taxable items i.e. enrolment and
product purchases and non-taxable items i.e. gift vouchers and enrolment
vouchers
* Bank process Banking report only shows cash and cheque payment type
items
* Fix to the Class Sign report to print the first session site and room
information, rather than the default class site and room info
* Fix for Statements of Attainment reports to ensure long unit of
competency names on the certificate face wrap instead of truncate
* Ensure rich text such as \{blocks} and \{image} textile in the course
marketing copy is not printed in the Enrolment Confirmation report
* Fix to the exception that could occur when printing the Trial Balance
report, where onCourse gave an error 'could not materialise value for
key 'accountOpeningCredit'
* Fix to a range of printed Budget reports to ensure wage expense lines
are itemized and included in totals
* Improvement to the Payslip export to include the fields for the
Course-Class code and the tutors payroll number
* Fix to the Class Hours report to ensure the Student Contact Hours are
correctly calculating
* Ensure the Transaction Summary and Detail reports print the selected
date range used to run the report, on the report
