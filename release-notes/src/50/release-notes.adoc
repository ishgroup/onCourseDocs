= Release 50
4 Nov. 2020

== Major features

=== Document sharing

We've completely reworked the document sharing user interface to make it clearer and easier to use, giving you a better understanding on each record of who can access the document record stored in your onCourse system, and from where.

=== Rich text

The new rich text user interface, introduced recently into the #editor and into the Sites window, has been rolled out across the rest of the onCourse application. If you're planning to update your content using the rich text mode, remember to keep these sections set with legacy mode until you have updated your content to markdown syntax.

=== Query language time

You can now search on datetime fields with relative time references like 'now'. The below example looks for records with an endDateTime between now and 4 hours from now.

    endDateTime in now .. now + 4 hours
