social constructionist pedagogy

http://mailchimp.com/[Mailchimp] – Online email marketing solution to
manage contacts, send emails and track results

These integrations allow you to create your own links to external
services and products you have purchased, and define with a
corresponding script how onCourse utilises these services.

=== New preferences windows

All onCourse preferences settings have been moved into a single window
with a more intuitive layout. Under File > Preferences > General… you'll

preference has been created for adding Holidays (unavailabilities) for
your whole of business timetable and scheduling availability.
