= Release 7.4
15 Jun 2015


== Major features

=== Documentation links added to all onCourse edit window views

In the bottom left hand corner of each window you will now see a
question mark icon. Clicking on this icon will take you directly to the
page of the onCourse user documentation that explains how to use that
part of onCourse. The link to the top level of the documentation is
still available in the Help menu.

=== Retaining outcomes on enrolment cancellation

Previously, when cancelling an enrolment in onCourse, all the outcomes
associated with the enrolment were deleted as part of the cancellation
process (unless those outcomes had been used to create a Statement of
Attainment or Qualification record in onCourse, in which case they were
kept). This meant that for funded courses, withdrawn students needed to
be kept as active enrolments in the class to be reported.

Now when you cancel an enrolment, by default all outcomes with a status
set will be retained. This allows you to cancel the enrolment for a
funded student, making the place in the class available for another,
while retaining their outcomes for reporting.

During the the enrolment cancellation a checkbox is ticked by default
that says 'Delete outcomes linked to this enrolment with status "not
set"'. If you have not given any outcomes a status yet, this may mean
all the outcomes attached to the enrolment. This will be desirable for
most types of enrolments, where you do not want to report the student as
having enrolled in this program at all for AVETMISS purposes.

If the student needs to be reported as a withdrawn student for AVETMISS
purposes, you have two options. Either set the value of the outcomes
before the cancellation process, and they will be retained by default.
Alternatively, you can untick the option 'Delete outcomes linked to this
enrolment with status "not set"' so all outcomes, both set and not set,
will be retained. To avoid AVETMISS errors, you will need to make sure
that any unset outcomes that are retained are given a valid outcomes
status, such as 60 – Withdrawn after processing the cancellation.

There is no change to the cancellation process when cancelling a class.
All outcomes will always be deleted, unless they have been used to to
create a Statement of Attainment or Qualification record in onCourse
before you cancel the class.

=== Addition of 'Certificate Awarded' and 'Certificate Issued' fields

By default, the date the certificate was created on is added to the
'Certificate Awarded' and the date the certificate was printed is added
to the 'Certificate issued' field. For both these new fields, you can
manually edit the date to any date you want.

The default onCourse Statement of Attainment, Qualification and
Transcript certificates now show these fields instead of the 'Created
on' and 'Printed on' fields. If you have a custom certificate template
and need assistance in updating it, please contact us

=== Addition of Skills Sets to the Qualification table

You can now create courses in onCourse linked to Skill Sets rather than
full Qualifications. This data is updated weekly from training.gov.au.
The wording in various parts of the user interface has been changed to
reference Qualification or Skill sets. From a course set up and AVETMISS
reporting perspective, a skill set is treated similarly to a
qualification. It is only during the certificate issuing process that a
special type of Statement of Attainment will be issued, rather than an
actual AQF Qualification.

== Reports and scripts

* Improvements have been made to the script edit view to allow you to
check if you have the latest copy of the script and upgrade it with a
single click `#24611`
* A description has been added to each script to explain what it does
* A link has been added to a CRON helper tool to enable you to change
the script schedule to your choice of date(s)

* A new report has been added to the discount window called 'Discount
take up summary'. This report shows during the date range specified, and
for each discount chosen, how many enrolments for each class have used
that particular discount. This report is for marketing purposes, so show
you the take-up success of a particular discount during a campaign date
range. `#24468`
* The standard Statement of Attainment, Qualification and Transcript
reports were updated to include the student middle name field. If we
have created a custom certificate report for you, this change was also
made to your custom report. If you have created your own custom report
and need assistance in updating it, please contact us. `#24195`
* A new report was added to show the projected pre-paid fee liabilty to
income journals for each of the next 7 months from the date the report
is run, for each class. This report can be found in the classes menu and
is called 'Income journal projection' `#24109`
* A fix was implemented for the trial balance report. Any accounts of
type expense were displayed on the credit side, and they have now been
correctly moved to the debit side `#24943`

== Minor features

* Checkbox added to class duplication to retain or discard payable time
`#24323`
* Allow promotional discounts and other discounts set to apply to all
new classes as default, to apply to private classes being created in
Quick Enrol `#24721`
* Allow voucher payment in Quick Enrol to apply to payer's previous
unpaid invoices `#24732`
* Search option 'created by' added to applications advanced search
options `#23985`
* New checkbox added to class and enrolment cancellation to send credit
note email. This option is checked by default. `#24053`

Maximum time that can be set is 6 hours. `#24256`
* Two factor authentication will be enabled for your users during their
next log in if you select the option in their access role to 'require
two factor authentication'. If the user cancels this window, it will be
shown to them again on every log in until it is enabled. `#23898`
* New access control permission has been added to for editing and
deleting record note items `#24277`
* Show/Hide filter preferences persists when you close and reopen the
window `#23042`
* Enrolments are now taggable. This allows you to create new tag groups
to assign to the enrolment level, such as a funding type, so you can
easily locate a group of enrolments for AVETMISS exporting `#24258`
* Enrolments now have notes. This allows you to record ad hoc notes
against a particular enrolment that will be automatically time and date
stamped with the user name of the person making the note `#24258`
* Added the VET FEE Help Census date field to the class advanced search
options `#24667`

create credit note reversals of any manual invoices joined to the class
`#24785`
* A new field has been added to the AVETMISS preferences panel for QLD
reporting RTOs to record their QLD RTO ID. For AVETMISS exporting
purposes, when choosing the export flavour QLD, this value will export,
instead of the standard national Identifier. It is important you retain
your national RTO ID in the 'Identifier' field to allow for the USI SOAP
Validation process to work `#25047`
* All icons and images inside the onCourse application have been updated
or otherwise adjusted to provide better visual support for retina

to be enabled and disabled for different user roles `#24509`
* Quick Enrol will now select the class starting next by default
`#24749`
* Fix to advanced search results when you are searching for date type
data 'on' a specific date. Previously a from and to date range was
required to return valid results `#25094`

=== AVETMISS improvements and fixes

* Improvement to the AVETMISS export rules for all states to set the At
School Flag to N when Labour Force Status Identifier equal to 01
`#24977`
* Fix for the Victorian AVETMISS export: where course commencement date
is earlier than the enrolment date then export the course commencement
date in the enrolment date field `#24633`
* Unicode characters are automatically replaced with ASCII characters in
AVETMISS export files during the export process e.g. Zoë will be
converted to Zoe for AVETMISS, but the student's preferred spelling will
be stored in onCourse and can be printed on their certificate `#24397`
* Added additional validation to the AVETMISS export process to prevent
outcomes with start and end dates different to their class dates from
exporting if their date range doesn't match those set in the export
runner `#25004`
