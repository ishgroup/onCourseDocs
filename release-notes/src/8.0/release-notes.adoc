Java 8 is now a minimum requirement to run onCourse. If your
organisation is not able to upgrade to Java 8, please contact us before
performing this upgrade.

version 7.10 and 8.0

== Major features

=== Payment plans

A new concept for enrolment fee payments has been developed to allow for
online enrolments by paying a deposit, and regular payments thereafter.

Payment plans consist of scripts which can be applied to classes en
masse, and plans in individual classes with payment dates and amounts
which can be modified as required.

The student fee window in the class has changed to allow for more
options in creating and setting a class fee with a deposit and then
additional amounts payable in relation to the class start date.

During enrolment, the default option of payment of a payment plan class
is for the deposit component only, but additional amounts up to the full
class fee can be taken at this time.

Any discount that applies to an enrolment will be deducted from the
final payment amount.

The invoice window layout has also had significant change to clean up
the view and accommodate the payment plan schedule. Within the payment
plan invoice, payable amounts and due dates can be adjusted, added or
removed, for the individual student. Any invoice can be manually turned
into a payment plan invoice if the balance was not paid in full on
enrolment.

The printed invoice template has also been updated to include the
payment plan schedule of dates and amounts payable, as have the email
templates.

When a student has an invoice with payment plan amounts due in the
future, and they enrol in another course, the future payable components
will not be added to their amount payable in Quick Enrol. Only overdue
payment amounts will be automatically added.

A new access right has been created for payment plans. Ensure you update
your access roles to allow the appropriate permissions for your staff to
create and edit payment plans within both classes and invoices.

A new chapter of user documentation has been written for Invoices and
Payment Plans

=== 3rd Party Integration preferences

A new window to create integration preferences has been added to
onCourse for the following popular commercial tools:

Moodle – A free, open-source PHP web application for producing modular
internet-based courses that support a modern social constructionist
pedagogy

Mailchimp – Online email marketing solution to manage contacts, send
emails and track results

SurveyMonkey – Create and publish online surveys in minutes, and view
the results graphically in real time. SurveyMonkey provides free online
questionnaire and survey software

SurveyGizmo – An exceptionally powerful survey tool designed to make
even the most advanced survey projects fun, easy and affordable

These integrations allow you to create your own links to external
services and products you have purchased, and define with a
corresponding script how onCourse utilises these services. For more
information, read the new onCourse integrations chapter of the user
handbook

,scaledwidth=100.0%]

=== Custom field drop down boxes for onCourse and the web

Custom fields for contact records can now be made into drop down
selections of choices for use inside both the onCourse application and
on your onCourse enrolment website. This feature allows you to define a
list of choices inside the custom field settings, separating each item
with a ; e.g. Radio; TV; Internet; *

If you include an asterisk (*) in the list as per the example above,
then your users will also have the option to type in free text as a
response. You can also log into your onCourse CMS to make these custom
fields, show or be a mandatory question as part of the online enrolment,
waitlist or mailing list process.

=== Retaining outcomes on enrolment cancellation

Previously, when cancelling an enrolment in onCourse, all the outcomes
associated with the enrolment were deleted as part of the cancellation
process (unless those outcomes had been used to create a Statement of
Attainment or Qualification record in onCourse, in which case they were
kept). This meant that for funded courses, withdrawn students needed to
be kept as active enrolments in the class to be reported.

Now when you cancel an enrolment, by default all outcomes with a status
set will be retained. This allows you to cancel the enrolment for a
funded student, making the place in the class available for another,
while retaining their outcomes for reporting.

During the the enrolment cancellation a checkbox is ticked by default
that says 'Delete outcomes linked to this enrolment with status "not
set"'. If you have not given any outcomes a status yet, this may mean
all the outcomes attached to the enrolment. This will be desirable for
most types of enrolments, where you do not want to report the student as
having enrolled in this program at all for AVETMISS purposes.

If the student needs to be reported as a withdrawn student for AVETMISS
purposes, you have two options. Either set the value of the outcomes
before the cancellation process, and they will be retained by default.
Alternatively, you can untick the option 'Delete outcomes linked to this
enrolment with status "not set"' so all outcomes, both set and not set,
will be retained. To avoid AVETMISS errors, you will need to make sure
that any unset outcomes that are retained are given a valid outcomes
status, such as 60 – Withdrawn after processing the cancellation.

There is no change to the cancellation process when cancelling a class.
All outcomes will always be deleted, unless they have been used to to
create a Statement of Attainment or Qualification record in onCourse
before you cancel the class.

=== Addition of 'Certificate Awarded' and 'Certificate Issued' fields

By default, the date the certificate was created on is added to the
'Certificate Awarded' and the date the certificate was printed is added
to the 'Certificate issued' field. For both these new fields, you can
manually edit the date to any date you want.

The default onCourse Statement of Attainment, Qualification and
Transcript certificates now show these fields instead of the 'Created
on' and 'Printed on' fields. If you have a custom certificate template
and need assistance in updating it, please contact us

=== Addition of Skills Sets to the Qualification table

You can now create courses in onCourse linked to Skill Sets rather than
full Qualifications. This data is updated weekly from training.gov.au.
The wording in various parts of the user interface has been changed to
reference Qualification or Skill sets. From a course set up and AVETMISS
reporting perspective, a skill set is treated similarly to a
qualification. It is only during the certificate issuing process that a
special type of Statement of Attainment will be issued, rather than an
actual AQF Qualification.

=== Documentation links added to all onCourse edit window views

In the bottom left hand corner of each window you will now see a
question mark icon. Clicking on this icon will take you directly to the
page of the onCourse user documentation that explains how to use that
part of onCourse. The link to the top level of the documentation is
still available in the Help menu.

=== User defined payment types

onCourse now allows you to add your own type of payment methods, for
example, VET FEE HELP, B-Pay or PayPal. You can also edit any existing
payment type that is included in onCourse, or remove a payment type that
you don't allow at your organisation e.g. cheque, provided you have
never taken any payments by that method.

=== Banking window restructure

The new banking window allows you to see all payment in and out
transactions grouped together on their banking date, including those
banked automatically such as credit card and EFTPOS. This will assist
with reconciliation process, as well as allow you to easily locate and
edit the banking dates of transactions such as EFT/direct deposit. To
access this window from the top menu by clicking on Financial ->
Banking. You can manually bank money from this window by clicking on the
'+' icon inside the banking list view. Alternatively, the 'Deposit
banking' window can still be accessed in the 'Accounts' tab of the
dashboard.

=== Transfer enrolment wizard

A transfer enrolment process has been added to the enrolment window cog
wheel function. This is similar to the 'cancel enrolment' process with
the addition of opening Quick Enrol at the end of the process, pre
loaded with the student, payer and course details, allowing you to make
a speedy transfer of the student to another class.

=== Re-style of all reports

All standard reports have been reformatted for a more consistent look
and feel, and to simplify the templates for custom changes.

=== Rebuild of all onCourse exports

All export CSV, XML and other custom templates have been migrated to
Groovy. This significantly reduces the load on your server when running
large data sets for export, and allows for much simpler custom export
editing.

=== New preferences windows

All onCourse preferences settings have been moved into a single window
with a more intuitive layout. Under File > Preferences > General… you'll
find all the general preferences previously available (College,
Licences, Messaging, Class Defaults, LDAP, Maintenance and AVETMISS).

Financial general preferences has been merged into this window and a new
preference has been created for adding Holidays (unavailabilities) for
your whole of business timetable and scheduling availability.

== Minor features

=== AVETMISS features and improvements

* A new field has been added to the AVETMISS preferences panel for QLD
reporting RTOs to record their QLD RTO ID. For AVETMISS exporting

your national RTO ID in the 'Identifier' field to allow for the USI SOAP
Validation process to work `#25047`

=== Scripts and templates

When a change has been made to a script or template, onCourse will not
automatically overwrite your files as you may have added your own
customisations. You can choose to update your templates and scripts
manually by accessing the latest versions on Git Hub.

* Improvements have been made to the script edit view to allow you to
check if you have the latest copy of the script and upgrade it with a
single click `#24611`
* A description has been added to each script to explain what it does
* A link has been added to a CRON helper tool to enable you to change
the script schedule to your choice of date(s)
* A new script (send enrolment notice for tutors) and accompanying email
template (enrolment notification) has been developed to send automatic
notifications of enrolment to a defined tutor contact for all classes
tagged with 'notify manager'. You can create a tutor role called 'course
manager' and the tutor assigned to the class with this role will receive
the notification. This script is disabled by default.
* An optional notification section for the USI reminder script has been
added, to alert a manager to the number of students emailed each week.
You can auto update your script using the button inside onCourse, or
manually by adding to the end:
+
`smtp {`
+
`from preference.email.admin`
+
`subject 'USI reminder email notification'`
+
`to preference.email.admin`
+
`content "A USI reminder was sent to ${enrolmentsWithoutUsi.size()} students enrolled in `
+
`VET classes who have not supplied their USI."`
+
`}`
+
You can manually change your script from preference.email.admin to the
actual email address of your choice `#24396 #21733`

scripting engine and can be used to trigger custom scripts `#25199`
* All new exports can now be called from, scheduled and emailed from
within a script `#25470`
* Wording in the default Voucher purchase plain text and HTML template
was made consistent, with the word 'quick' removed from the HTML voucher
template. You can update the wording of your HTML template from Git Hub
* Labels for tax amounts updated in the plain text Tax Invoice. Total is
now shown inclusive of tax, and tax is itemized separately. You can
update the wording of your plain text template to the latest version
from Git Hub
* Payment plan payment dates and amounts payable have also been added to
the Tax Invoice plain text and HTML templates. The link for the item
above is directly to the plain text template which includes these
changes. You can update the wording of your HTML text template to the
latest version from Git Hub
* An optional clause can be added to the student and tutor reminder
scripts to only send to classes that have met their minimum enrolment
requirements
+
`{ if `
+
`(courseClass.successAndQueuedEnrolments.size() >= courseClass.minimumPlaces ) `
+
`} `

== Fixes

=== Seach and find related fixes

* For find related 'contacts purchased' from product find contacts with
successful purchases, and exclude contacts with failed purchase attempts
`#24211`
* For the advanced search option in contacts 'number of enrolments' only
count active enrolments, and exclude failed, cancelled or credited
enrolments `#24504`
* Fix to advanced search results when you are searching for date type
data 'on' a specific date. Previously a from and to date range was
required to return valid results `#25094`
* Improvements were made to the 'find related' options for vouchers so
that find related invoice finds invoices created on voucher purchase
(including $0 invoices) and any invoices created on voucher redemption,
and find related enrolment finds any enrolment purchases where the
voucher was used as a payment method `#25237`
* A range of advanced search fixes to remove any instances of case
sensitivity `#25674`

=== Course, class and enrolment fixes

* Quick Enrol window layout was adjusted so relationships window was
better accessible as it was sometimes drawn off screen `#22983`
* Ensure outcomes tab correctly updates UOC when the course code is
changed to another course after class creation. The course code can not
be changed for a class once the class has enrolments `#23570`
* Quick Enrol will now select the class starting next by default
`#24749`

=== Finance fixes

* Fix to the layout of the payment in and payment out window defaults so
fields are not truncated from view `#25036`
* Apply rounding options to final price instead of just discount value.
This will correct some 1c rounding issues that may show on purchases
which have GST applied `#25094`, `#25059`, `#24133`
* Fix to the payment out post processing process to ensure the refund
advice email is sent where enabled by the corresponding script`#10073`
* Fix to the voucher expiry job to ensure that vouchers where the

`#13396`

=== VET and Certification fixes

wheel. In summary: When a course is 'sufficient for qualification' a
qualification is created for student where all outcomes have been
successfully achieved, a Statement of Attainment when some of outcomes
are successful and some unsuccessful, and no certificate is created when
all outcomes are unsuccessful. When a course is NOT 'sufficient for
qualification', a Statement of Attainment is created when at least one
outcome was successful, and no certificate is created when all outcomes
are unsuccessful `#24223`
* Allow private classes and traineeships to be marked as self paced on
creation `#25008`

==== General fixes

* Significant performance improvements were made to the loading of list
windows in onCourse so they will open noticeably faster `#24489`
* Emails that are unable to be sent due to mail configuration errors
will stay in the mail queue rather than be marked as failed on the
sending attempt `#24149`
* Fix to user account permission 'override tutor payrate' to allow this
to be enabled and disabled for different user roles `#24509`
* Students TFNs were being cleared from their record when it was opened
in Quick Enrol. This has has been fixed `#25116`
* Any 'Special Needs' notations made on the Documents tab are not being
retained after saving and closing. This has has been fixed `#25178`
* Students that have no active enrolments are not displayed under
'students currently enrolled' filter `#19074`
* Fix to discount window where save process could fail if classes are
added before a discount name `#25269`

record value as expected `#25343`
* VET Fee Help charged value automatically calculates to be inclusive of
any discounts or tax applied to the enrolment fee `#25513`

exported consistent with the values displayed in the class budget view
`#25384`
* Fix to the cancel voucher UI to allow a cancellation fee to be charged
`#25790`
* The "timetables" view has been removed from onCourse. This view was
not well optimised for speed and the way it displayed all sessions from
all classes in one big view wasn't terribly useful. The poor performance
of this view was giving new users a bad impression, where there are
better ways to show a timetable from site, room, class, course, student
or tutor views. We'll restore this view once we have a more useful
interface designed.

== Improvements and fixes added since 7.10 release

* Fix to 'Course details report' to correctly display nominal hours and
reportable hours`##26106`
* Fix to MYOB summary export process which was not completing since 7.10
`#26031`
* Load of preference window speed has been improved `#26076`
* Change to end date of the discount period to mean 11.59pm on the
nominated date. Previously is meant 12.00am on the date `#26050`
* Deposit banking only shows payment out records that were successfully
processed. Failed transactions are suppressed from this list `#26037`
* $0 transactions are now suppressed from the student statement report
`#25811`
* onCourse users can not create export templates that begin with the key
code 'ish'. This is a reserved code to indicate that that the template
was packaged with the onCourse product and is under version control.
Users can create their own key codes containing their organisation name.
