= Release 8.10
22 Jan 2016


== Important changes

=== Optional USI script change

Please read this information carefully and decide if you wish to update
the default script 'Send USI reminder'.

The USI reminder has been adjusted to send to only to students enrolled
in courses with units of competency attached. The previous
implementation was to send to VET flagged courses, however some onCourse
users VET flag courses with no modules for funding purposes, and those
students don't need a USI. An additional line has also been added to
send a notification to your onCourse admin email address (as per your
onCourse message preference settings) each time this message is sent,
advising how many students were contacted. If you wish to update your
script to the new version as described, please go to File > Preferences
> Scripts and locate 'send USI reminder'. Double click on the script and
click the button 'Update to latest version'. Ensure the 'enabled' flag
is also set. You may also wish to adjust your enrolment confirmation
email template that sends the first USI request to enrolling students.
In both the plain text and HTML email, before the USI request text is a
string that says:

....
 <% if (enrolment.courseClass.course.isVET == true) { %>
....

Replace it with:

....
 <% if (enrolment.courseClass.course.modules.size() > 0) { %>
....

== Major features

=== Import AVETMISS outcome data from NAT00080, NAT00085 & NAT00120 files

Of particular use to customers new to onCourse transitioning from
another AVETMISS enabled student management system, onCourse will now
allow you to import and create student contacts from the combination of
NAT00080, NAT00085 & NAT00120 files. The NAT00080, NAT00085 will create
contact records in onCourse, and any enrolment data in the NAT00120
(whether VET or non-VET) will be added as prior learning records to the
student files created.

column, so when you close a list view and reopen it, it will reopen

down the shift key and clicking on multiple column headers. The sort
order is determined by the order the column headers are clicked upon i.e

second column clicked ect. `#20965`
* For AVETMISS field values that populate from class, to enrolment and
then to outcome, the lock/unlock icon is used to show where values have

unlocked padlock) `#25252`
