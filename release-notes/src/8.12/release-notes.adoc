= Release 8.12
10 Mar 2016


== Major features

=== Find related record icon relocation

The find related records function in onCourse is such a regularly used
and powerful function of the onCourse application, that we have moved
this feature out of the cogwheel list and in to its very own own action
icon to make it more prominant. You can now access the 'Find related'
feature to the right of the search box in all onCourse list views. It's
icon looks like a magnifying glass hovering over a stack of papers.

=== Class cancellation notifications moved to script and email templates

When a class was cancelled in previous versions of onCourse, a window
opened asking if the user wanted to send a message to the students to
notify them, using a template that couldn't be easily customised. To
make this process consistant with other automated notifications, a new
script and email template set have been developed to replace this manual
message. Please review the new template called 'Enrolment cancellation'
and make the appropriate changes for your college before enabling this
script.

The new script 'Send enrolment cancellation' is disabled by default. If
you wish to use it at your college you will need to enable it. Please
note that enabling this script will automatically send the 'Enrolment
cancellation' email message to all enrolled students each time you
cancel a class. If this script is enabled this process will happen in
the background without the opportunity to review or disable the sending
of the message.

Another new script and email template pair have been added to notify
tutors when a class is cancelled, in the same way students are notified.
Review the script called 'Send tutor class cancellation' which is
disabled by default, and 'Tutor notice of class cancellation' email
template for any adjustments you wish to make before enabling this
script.

Note these scripts do not trigger when an enrolment is cancelled - only
when a class is cancelled.
