== Major features

=== Automated printing and portal distribution of Certificates of Attendance

A new set of features involving onCourse scripts, email templates, post
class satisfaction surveys and document uploads to the skillsOnCourse
portal comes together in a new feature set for automatic distribution of
Attendance Certificates for non-VET courses.

Each day, for classes that ended the previous day, onCourse will create
and upload to the student portal a Certificate of Attendance for each
enrolled student. Optionally, you can set the script to check attendance
has also reached a certain threshold, like 80%, before issuing this
certificate.

For students issued with a certificate, a new email template will be
sent with a one time password free login link to take them straight to
the portal page where they can then download and print their
certificate.

The default wording in the email template encourages the student to
complete the simple satisfaction survey built into the portal, so you
can start collecting 5 star ratings for the class venue, tutor and
content, plus an optional comment.

As per all new scripts and templates, this is disabled by default, and
we encourage you to customise the wording of the 'Certificate available'
email before activating this script at your college.

Deatiled documentation for enabling and customising this feature is
available in the user handbook:

Guide - Non-VET Certificates of Attendance]

=== Automated creation of VET Certificates

Unlike non-VET Certificates of Attendance, formal VET certifications
like Statements of Attainment and Qualifications can only be issued when
a student achieves outcome results for the units that make up their
course.

A new script in onCourse checks daily for any outcome results which have
been updated during the previous 24 hours, and if all the outcomes
attached to the enrolment have be set to have an outcome status, a VET
certification will be created if at least one of those outcomes was
successful.

Where the student has successfully achieved all outcomes linked to a
course which 'satisfies complete qualification or skill set', then they
will be issued a Qualification or Skill Set Certificate on completion.
If all outcomes have been marked, and some are unsuccessful, they will
be issued a Statement of Attainment instead.

For students undertaking a short course, who have successfully, or a mix
of successfully and unsuccessfully, completed their outcomes, a
Statement of Attainment will also be created for their successful units.

user handbook:

=== onCourse Menu Restructure

To improve clarity and ensure all new onCourse features have a home in
the menu system, we have restructured the top level menus to better
group related items.

A new menu option called 'Products' includes all the items you can sell
via onCourse, including Courses, Gift Vouchers and Memberships.

The menu item 'Training' contains the features related to setting up and
scheduling training, including items such as Classes, Sites and
Documents.

The previous menu 'People' has been split into two menus: The new
'People' menu contains the options to access contacts and their
communication history via mailing lists and messages, while the new
'Activity' menu is where you will find Quick Enrol and all the results
of contact engagement with onCourse including Applications, Enrolments,
Certificates and Sales.

All options related to fees and payments, including CorporatePasses and
Discounts can be found under the 'Financial' menu.

The File, Edit, Windows and Help menu options are unchanged.
