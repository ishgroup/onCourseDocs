= Release 8.20
4 July 2016


== Important changes

Hello and welcome to your latest onCourse upgrade! From this release
onwards, each time a new onCourse version is released, the release notes
will be displayed to each onCourse user when they log in, inside the
application.

Take a moment to read through this screen to understand what has changed
since the last time you logged in. When you are done here, just close
the window. Once you've closed the window, you won't see this alert
again until the next upgrade is deployed.

Release notes are also published on our website, so you can always visit
http://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/release-notes/ to refer to this
release again, or any previous release notes.

=== DateTime format changes for custom reports

All onCourse system reports and exports have been updated, however if
you have created your own custom reports or exports, you may encounter
some exceptions when running them where we have upgraded some dateTime
fields to localDate. Changing date formats from
"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX" to "yyyy-MM-dd" should resolve your problems.
Refer to the onCourse API documentation or contact us for assistance as
needed.

== Major features

=== Improved record loading speed over high latency internet links

The performance of communication between onCourse Client and Server has
been dramatically improved. Opening and saving windows is improved
throughout the whole application, but most noticeably if you are
connecting over the internet (such as our cloud hosted solution).
Improvements range from 20-30% in some cases to reducing the delay by a
factor of 10 in other cases.

=== Allow Discounts to change fee charged instead of charge to expenses

Previously, all discounts processed within onCourse processed the value
of the discount to the default COS (cost of sale) account as defined by
the financial preferences, called 'discounts given'. For example, if
your class fee was $100, with a $20 discount, so the student was charged
$80, then $100 income would be earnt by the transaction, with $20 of COS
expense posted.

Substantial changes have been made to the way discounts can be created
in the system so they can be either be a:

[arabic]
. *Discount linked to your choice of COS Account from those created in
the accounts list in general ledger.* You can now post each discount
type to it's own COS account or create a COS account for each
department. This type of setup is recommended for discounts like
senior's card discounts or promotional activities.
. *Discount linked to no COS account.* These types of discounts are
treated as an adjustment to the income earnt e.g. if the class fee was
$100, with a $20 discount posted to no COS account, so the student fee
is $80, then $80 income would be earnt by the transaction, with no
expense posted. For 'change of fee' type discounts, like Smart and
Skilled student fees, using the no COS discount type is recommended.

Changes to existing discount COS allocations will not change
transactions created in the past; it will only affect transactions
created after the change.

All manual discounts in Quick Enrol, and discounts in manual invoices
will post as a reduction of income, rather than to the COS expense.

The
http://ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/manual/discounts.html[Discounts
chapter] of the user documentation has been revised to document in
detail all of these changes

=== Allow transaction dates to be edited before period finalised

To allow for end of month Financial reporting adjustments, transaction
effective dates prior to the date the record was created can now be set
in onCourse. This will allow finance users to move transactions that
occur early in a new month to be pushed back into the month prior, for
invoices, payments in and payments out, and for the same types of
transactions to be moved forward in time as needed. Journals can also be
posted into the past.

Once a month end's movements are complete, the period should be
finalised, to avoid further movements during that date range. A new UI
has been added to the Financial menu options to Finalise Period.

Reports printed that include transactions in unlocked period include a
red warning on the last page ""This report includes unposted transaction
periods which are subject to change."

=== New account - Undeposited funds

A new default asset account has been created called 'undeposited funds'.
This accounts holds the balance of all unbanked payment in and payment
out transactions. When the payment is banked, it is transferred to the
'deposited funds' asset account. Payment methods that are marked as bank
automatically will always be deposited directly into the 'deposited
funds' accounts. Only payment methods that are banked manually are first
created in the 'undeposited funds' account. Payments that have their
banking date removed are deducted from the 'deposited funds' account and
returned to the 'undeposited funds' account.

=== Bank reconciliation redesign

The Bank Reconciliation process inside onCourse has been redesigned to
work from within the Banking Deposit list, rather than in a separate
window. Whole banking deposit records can be reconciled with a single
click, or balanced transaction by transaction.

In concert with this change, the associated reconciliation reports have
also been renamed 'Cash movements reports'.

The
http://ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/manual/accounting.html#accounting-Deposit[Banking
and Reconciliation] chapter of the user handbook has been revised to
document in detail all of these changes

=== Default tax setting per income account

Each income account now has the option to set a default tax value. This
will automatically apply the selected tax option when the income account
is chosen during the class set up process, or when a manual invoice is
generated. The user can still choose to change the tax to another option
available as needed.

We recommend all finance managers review the default tax status of each
account after the upgrade and ensure the default option for each income
account is the more commonly used value i.e. does GST apply to most
transactions in this account or not. Changing these values do not change
any previous transactions in the system or any existing account/tax
combinations, but will ensure less user errors in tax selection are made
going forward.

=== New duplicate course option

This feature is of particular interest to RTO onCourse users, who may
need to re-create courses regularly as training packages change or
internally unit clustering changes. In the course cogwheel, a 'duplicate
course' option will copy all the marketing and attached VET unit
information from an existing course and automatically add a '1' to the
end of the course code. This new course can then have units quickly
added, deleted or otherwise adjusted. By default, all duplicated courses
are set to be enabled on creation, but will not display on the web until
you set that value. NOTE: attached documents and related
courses/products do not duplicate with the course. This additional
function will be added as part of the next onCourse release.

create your own unique code. `#28063`
* Improvement to the 'send certificate vet created notification' script
to set the issued on date to the day the certificate was automatically

* Improvement to the 'send weekly finance summary report' script with
the addition of a send monthly option. If you are using this script and

click 'update to the latest version'. Then, comment out the weekly time
range, and uncomment the monthly time range`#27107`
