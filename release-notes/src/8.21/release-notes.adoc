== Reports and scripts

* Two new AVETMISS imports were added to onCourse, allowing users to

existing student records with the same First Name, Last Name and Date of
Birth. `#26792`

            ${enrolment.invoiceLine.taxEach.isZero() ? 'free' : 'inc'} `
+

`Fee Paid: ${enrolment.invoiceLine.discountedPriceTotalIncTax} GST ${enrolment.invoiceLine.taxEach.isZero() ? 'free' : 'inc'} `
