= Release 8.24



== Major features

=== Automatically generate verification QR code for certificates

In preparation for the deployment of the onCourse Certificate
Verification service, Statements of Attainment and Qualifications can
now be printed with a unique QR (Quick Response) code and manual URL
verification code.

The Certificate Verification service will allow employers or other RTOs
to confirm the certificate was issued to the student named without
requiring them phone, or otherwise contact the RTO to request look up of
the Certificate number in the register. This web portal feature is
currently in testing and will be deployed shortly.

Printing the built in certificate template will allow you to print
Statement of Attainment and Qualification certificates with or without a
QR code. All RTOs wishing to use the verification portal should check
the default location of the QR code on their onCourse certificate report
and make adjustments to the background report elements or location of
the QR code in the report as necessary. If you wish to add the QR code
to existing custom certificate reports, you can contact ish for
assistance.
