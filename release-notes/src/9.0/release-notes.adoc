again until the next upgrade is deployed.

== Major features

=== onCourse Certificate Verification Portal

The onCourse Certificate Verification Portal has now been deployed for
all customers who have implemented the QR code printing function on
their onCourse Qualification and Statement of Attainment certificates.

The Certificate Verification Portal will allow employers or other RTOs
to confirm the certificate was issued to the student named without
requiring them phone, or otherwise contact the RTO to request look up of
the Certificate number in the register.

By taking a snapshot of the QR code printed on your certificates,
clicking in the code from a PDF certificate of visiting
http://www.skills.courses and typing in the unique certificate code, a
verification page will be displayed with an electronic record of the
units successfully completed, student name and date of issue. Revoked or
otherwise invalid certificates will display 'no certificate found'.

=== User interface changes

==== onCourse Menu Restructure

To improve clarity and ensure all new onCourse features have a home in
the menu system, we have restructured the top level menus to better
group related items.

A new menu option called 'Products' includes all the items you can sell
via onCourse, including Courses, Gift Vouchers and Memberships.

The menu item 'Training' contains the features related to setting up and
scheduling training, including items such as Classes, Sites and
Documents.

The previous menu 'People' has been split into two menus: The new
'People' menu contains the options to access contacts and their
communication history via mailing lists and messages, while the new
'Activity' menu is where you will find Quick Enrol and all the results
of contact engagement with onCourse including Applications, Enrolments,
Certificates and Sales.

All options related to fees and payments, including CorporatePasses and
Discounts can be found under the 'Financial' menu.

The File, Edit, Windows and Help menu options are unchanged.

==== Find related record icon relocation

The find related records function in onCourse is such a regularly used
and powerful function of the onCourse application, that we have moved
this feature out of the cogwheel list and in to its very own own action
icon to make it more prominant. You can now access the 'Find related'
feature to the right of the search box in all onCourse list views. It's
icon looks like a magnifying glass hovering over a stack of papers.

==== Payment In & Quick Enrol redesign for payment processing

Creating a payment separately from an enrolment process used to open a
'payment in' window. The window that opens now is Quick Enrol.
Validation has been removed from inside Quick Enrol requiring the
transaction to contain at least one purchase.

Now, you can use Quick Enrol to process payments against invoices with
outstanding balances. You can do this via the normal Quick Enrol window,
or when clicking on the plus option inside the payment in list view.
This change in user interface also introduces the opportunity for
vouchers to be used as payment method after the enrolment process.

==== onCourse font change

The onCourse system font has been changed to SourceSansPro to allow for
clearer display on Retina and other high resolution screens.

==== Preference user interface updates

The preference settings for payment types, custom fields, contact
relations and concession types have been moved from being their own menu
item and windows, to being added to the list of preference options in
the File > Preferences > General list view.

==== Class cancellation notifications moved to script and email templates

When a class was cancelled in previous versions of onCourse, a window
opened asking if the user wanted to send a message to the students to
notify them, using a template that couldn't be easily customised. To
make this process consistant with other automated notifications, a new
script and email template set have been developed to replace this manual
message. Please review the new template called 'Enrolment cancellation'
and make the appropriate changes for your college before enabling this
script.

The new script 'Send enrolment cancellation' is disabled by default. If
you wish to use it at your college you will need to enable it. Please
note that enabling this script will automatically send the 'Enrolment
cancellation' email message to all enrolled students each time you
cancel a class. If this script is enabled this process will happen in
the background without the opportunity to review or disable the sending
of the message.

Another new script and email template pair have been added to notify
tutors when a class is cancelled, in the same way students are notified.
Review the script called 'Send tutor class cancellation' which is
disabled by default, and 'Tutor notice of class cancellation' email
template for any adjustments you wish to make before enabling this
script.

Note these scripts do not trigger when an enrolment is cancelled - only
when a class is cancelled.

==== Improved record loading speed over high latency internet links

The performance of communication between onCourse Client and Server has
been dramatically improved. Opening and saving windows is improved
throughout the whole application, but most noticeably if you are
connecting over the internet (such as our cloud hosted solution).
Improvements range from 20-30% in some cases to reducing the delay by a
factor of 10 in other cases.

==== Improved performance across the application

Improve performance across the application, and especially in the class
edit view. Over slow internet links the performance can be up to 10
times faster for certain actions.

=== RTO Features

==== onCourse portal refresh

A major refresh of the onCourse portal application has signficantly
improved the functionality for students, tutors, employers, agents and
parents.

The new group timetable view, scrolling schedule timetable view,
improved class roll attendance marking and payment gateway has been
deployed. A brand new dashboard, outcome marking module and certificate
verification service are also available.

==== Automated creation of VET Certificates

Unlike non-VET Certificates of Attendance, formal VET certifications
like Statements of Attainment and Qualifications can only be issued when
a student achieves outcome results for the units that make up their
course.

A new script in onCourse checks daily for any outcome results which have
been updated during the previous 24 hours, and if all the outcomes
attached to the enrolment have be set to have an outcome status, a VET
certification will be created if at least one of those outcomes was
successful.

Where the student has successfully achieved all outcomes linked to a
course which 'satisfies complete qualification or skill set', then they
will be issued a Qualification or Skill Set Certificate on completion.
If all outcomes have been marked, and some are unsuccessful, they will
be issued a Statement of Attainment instead.

For students undertaking a short course, who have successfully, or a mix
of successfully and unsuccessfully, completed their outcomes, a
Statement of Attainment will also be created for their successful units.

Deatiled documentation for enabling this feature is available in the
user handbook:
https://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/manual/rto.html#rto-Certificates[VET
Qualifications and other Certificates]

==== Distribution of VET Certificates through the portal

A new script has been added to automatically print and distribute VET
Certificates through the skillsOnCourse portal called 'send certificate
vet created notification'. Like all new scripts, it is disabled by
default and you will need to enable it if you wish to use it.

Each day, all unprinted VET Certificates for student who have a
validated USI will be printed to PDF and saved to the student's
enrolment record.

You will need to make sure you have created and uploaded the following
three two page background documents to onCourse before enabling this
script: vet_qualification_background.pdf, vet_skillset_background.pdf,
and vet_soa_background.pdf. The script will overlay the certificate
template on the correct background type during the print process.

The Certificate will then be uploaded to the student portal, and the
student sent an email notifying them is available for download.

The same email template, 'Certificate available', also called on by the
non-VET Certificate of Attendance distribution script is sent. Ensure
any modifications you make to the template suit the recipient of both
VET and non-VET certificates, or create a copy of the template to send a
different email to VET certified students.

==== Automatically generate verification QR code for certificates

In preparation for the deployment of the onCourse Certificate
Verification service, Statements of Attainment and Qualifications can
now be printed with a unique QR (Quick Response) code and manual URL
verification code.

The Certificate Verification service will allow employers or other RTOs
to confirm the certificate was issued to the student named without
requiring them phone, or otherwise contact the RTO to request look up of
the Certificate number in the register. This web portal feature is
currently in testing and will be deployed shortly.

Printing the built in certificate template will allow you to print
Statement of Attainment and Qualification certificates with or without a
QR code. All RTOs wishing to use the verification portal should check
the default location of the QR code on their onCourse certificate report
and make adjustments to the background report elements or location of
the QR code in the report as necessary. If you wish to add the QR code
to existing custom certificate reports, you can contact ish for
assistance.

==== onCourse Certificate Verification Portal

The onCourse Certificate Verification Portal has now been deployed for
all customers who have implemented the QR code printing function on
their onCourse Qualification and Statement of Attainment certificates.

The Certificate Verification Portal will allow employers or other RTOs
to confirm the certificate was issued to the student named without
requiring them phone, or otherwise contact the RTO to request look up of
the Certificate number in the register.

By taking a snapshot of the QR code printed on your certificates,
clicking in the code from a PDF certificate of visiting
http://www.skills.courses and typing in the unique certificate code, a
verification page will be displayed with an electronic record of the
units successfully completed, student name and date of issue. Revoked or
otherwise invalid certificates will display 'no certificate found'.

would like some assistance to do so, please get in contact with us at
support@ish.com.au

==== AVETMISS 8

The new AVETMISS export has been added to this release of onCourse which
includes the additional delivery modes.

image:images/AVETMISS_8.png[ AVETMISS 8 Export window
,scaledwidth=80.0%]

==== AVETMISS improvements

A new 'suppress for AVETMISS' field has been added to the enrolment
record. This will let users met the NSW Smart & Skilled reporting
requirements of reporting and retaining records of a deferred or
discontinued student once, and then suppress the data from reporting in
subsequent monthly reports without needing to cancel the enrolment in
onCourse.

The AVETMISS export runner default has also been changed to
automatically tick and select the option 'Export 90 for VET outcomes
which are not set'. This can still be changed to export another value,
and won't affect the rules that govern the export of two blank spaces
for NSW Smart & Skilled or 70 for outcomes completing in the following
calendar year.

==== New duplicate course option

This feature is of particular interest to RTO onCourse users, who may
need to re-create courses regularly as training packages change or
internally unit clustering changes. In the course cogwheel, a 'duplicate
course' option will copy all the marketing and attached VET unit
information from an existing course and automatically add a '1' to the
end of the course code. This new course can then have units quickly
added, deleted or otherwise adjusted. By default, all duplicated courses
are set to be enabled on creation, but will not display on the web until
you set that value. NOTE: attached documents and related
courses/products do not duplicate with the course.

==== Import AVETMISS outcome data from NAT00080, NAT00085 & NAT00120 files

Of particular use to customers new to onCourse transitioning from
another AVETMISS enabled student management system, onCourse will now
allow you to import and create student contacts from the combination of
NAT00080, NAT00085 & NAT00120 files. The NAT00080, NAT00085 will create
contact records in onCourse, and any enrolment data in the NAT00120
(whether VET or non-VET) will be added as prior learning records to the
student files created.

==== Rewrite of the import feature

onCourse imports have been re-written in a groovy syntax, making them
easier for users to edit and extend. The most commonly used import, the
AVETMISS 80 & 85 allows you to customise the student contact data import
using AVETMISS files generated by another student management system.

==== Prior Learning data

To extend upon the exisiting AVETMISS data import option in onCourse
that was used to create student records, the NAT0060 and NAT00120 files
can also be imported to creating prior learning records in onCourse.
This allows for simple migration from another AVETMISS compliant student
management systems. The prior learning table can also be used to add
enrolment and outcome data to exisiting students inside onCourse, where
learning has taken place externally to the onCourse system.

These records are visible in the contact enrolment tab 'outcomes' list,
like other outcomes the student obtains via onCourse enrolments.

==== Prior learning edit and export

Prior learning data imported into onCourse now has its own view in the
contact education tab. These records can be double clicked to edit, and
new records can be added manually. All prior learning data added
manually or via import will also be collected and exported in whole of
college date range AVETMISS reporting.

=== Financial Features

==== Default invoice terms per contact

A new field has been added to the general preferences to allow for a
default due date for all invoices to be set. Previously, the default due
date was always the day of creation. In addition, each contact in
onCourse can have their own default due date that overrides the default,
so you can offer a range of relative terms like 7 days, 14 days, 31 days
to auto calculate an invoice due date for your corporate clients. This
features ties in with the new invoice payment due reminder script and
portal payment gateway also included in this release.

==== Allow transaction dates to be edited before period finalised

To allow for end of month Financial reporting adjustments, transaction
effective dates prior to the date the record was created can now be set
in onCourse. This will allow finance users to move transactions that
occur early in a new month to be pushed back into the month prior, for
invoices, payments in and payments out, and for the same types of
transactions to be moved forward in time as needed. Journals can also be
posted into the past.

Once a month end's movements are complete, the period should be
finalised, to avoid further movements during that date range. A new UI
has been added to the Financial menu options to Finalise Period.

Reports printed that include transactions in unlocked period include a
red warning on the last page ""This report includes unposted transaction
periods which are subject to change."

==== New account - Undeposited funds

A new default asset account has been created called 'undeposited funds'.
This accounts holds the balance of all unbanked payment in and payment
out transactions. When the payment is banked, it is transferred to the
'deposited funds' asset account. Payment methods that are marked as bank
automatically will always be deposited directly into the 'deposited
funds' accounts. Only payment methods that are banked manually are first
created in the 'undeposited funds' account. Payments that have their
banking date removed are deducted from the 'deposited funds' account and
returned to the 'undeposited funds' account.

==== Bank reconciliation redesign

The Bank Reconciliation process inside onCourse has been redesigned to
work from within the Banking Deposit list, rather than in a separate
window. Whole banking deposit records can be reconciled with a single
click, or balanced transaction by transaction.

In concert with this change, the associated reconciliation reports have
also been renamed 'Cash movements reports'.

The
http://ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/manual/accounting.html#accounting-Deposit[Banking
and Reconciliation] chapter of the user handbook has been revised to
document in detail all of these changes

==== Default tax setting per income account

Each income account now has the option to set a default tax value. This
will automatically apply the selected tax option when the income account
is chosen during the class set up process, or when a manual invoice is
generated. The user can still choose to change the tax to another option
available as needed.

We recommend all finance managers review the default tax status of each
account after the upgrade and ensure the default option for each income
account is the more commonly used value i.e. does GST apply to most
transactions in this account or not. Changing these values do not change
any previous transactions in the system or any existing account/tax
combinations, but will ensure less user errors in tax selection are made
going forward.

==== Allow Discounts to change fee charged instead of charge to expenses

Previously, all discounts processed within onCourse processed the value
of the discount to the default COS (cost of sale) account as defined by
the financial preferences, called 'discounts given'. For example, if
your class fee was $100, with a $20 discount, so the student was charged
$80, then $100 income would be earnt by the transaction, with $20 of COS
expense posted.

Substantial changes have been made to the way discounts can be created
in the system so they can be either be a:

[arabic]
. *Discount linked to your choice of COS Account from those created in
the accounts list in general ledger.* You can now post each discount
type to it's own COS account or create a COS account for each
department. This type of setup is recommended for discounts like
senior's card discounts or promotional activities.
. *Discount linked to no COS account.* These types of discounts are
treated as an adjustment to the income earnt e.g. if the class fee was
$100, with a $20 discount posted to no COS account, so the student fee
is $80, then $80 income would be earnt by the transaction, with no
expense posted. For 'change of fee' type discounts, like Smart and
Skilled student fees, using the no COS discount type is recommended.

Changes to existing discount COS allocations will not change
transactions created in the past; it will only affect transactions
created after the change.

All manual discounts in Quick Enrol, and discounts in manual invoices
will post as a reduction of income, rather than to the COS expense.

The
http://ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/manual/discounts.html[Discounts
chapter] of the user documentation has been revised to document in
detail all of these changes

==== New types of discounts

Two new bulk purchase discount types were added to onCourse. One option
allows you to define discounts based on the number of enrolments in the
transaction e.g. enrol 2 people and each get 5% off, or buy one get one
free.

The second option allows you to define a discount based on the total
value of the invoice, e.g. a 10% discount applies when the total invoice
value is over $1000.

Corporate passes can now also be linked directly to discounts, so
employers or agents enrolling students can have access to a special
price.

Discounts can now also be for a negative amount i.e. the discount raises
the class fee instead of lowering it. If an enrolment is eligible for
multiple types of discounts, and one of these discounts raises the class
fee, that discount will be selected by default.

In the case where an enrolment is eligible for multiple types of
discounts that reduce the class fee, as always, the best price for the
enrolling student will be selected by default.

With the new addition of these more complicated types of discounts, the
option to 'combine discounts' has now been removed from onCourse.

==== Discount override at the class level

This new feature allows you to override the discount value at the class
level, to assign varying class fees sharing the same discount name. This
option may be especially useful for funded programs like Smart &
Skilled. For example, a number of courses and classes can share the
discount 'First Qualification rate' but each class can have it's own
discounted price. Double click on the discount in the class budget tab
to edit it.

==== Discount offset from class start date

In addition to discounts running for a set date period, discounts can
now be set to be valid as an offset from the class start date. The
offset can allow the discount to run prior to the start date, or after
the start date. This will allow the creation of both early bird style
pricing and discounts for in-term enrolments.

==== Payroll Improvements

Tutors can now be attached to classes with multiple roles and payrates,
allowing you to assign the same contact, for example, as both a tutor
with an hourly payrate and an assessor with a per enrolment pay rate.
Per session pay rates now display the correct pay value in the class
budget, depending on the number of sessions the tutor is assigned to,
rather than multiplying the rate by the total number of sessions in the
class.

The payslip edit view layout has been rebuilt to better group and
display line items and make the editing processes, where class defaults
are overridden, clearer by displaying variations with red text. A
cogwheel option has been added next to each pay line item, replacing the
cross/delete icon, allowing you to 'defer to next pay run' to improve
the clarity of what this function does.

When you choose to defer a pay line, it will be removed from the pay
slip total for the current period, but when the payroll is generated for
the following pay period, it will appear again on that payslip. This
will continue until the pay line is processed via a pay slip.

===

=== Reports and scripts

Please read this information carefully and decide if you wish to update
the default script 'Send USI reminder'.

The USI reminder has been adjusted to send to only to students enrolled
in courses with units of competency attached. The previous
implementation was to send to VET flagged courses, however some onCourse
users VET flag courses with no modules for funding purposes, and those
students don't need a USI. An additional line has also been added to
send a notification to your onCourse admin email address (as per your
onCourse message preference settings) each time this message is sent,
advising how many students were contacted. If you wish to update your
script to the new version as described, please go to File > Preferences
> Scripts and locate 'send USI reminder'. Double click on the script and
click the button 'Update to latest version'. Ensure the 'enabled' flag
is also set. You may also wish to adjust your enrolment confirmation
email template that sends the first USI request to enrolling students.
In both the plain text and HTML email, before the USI request text is a
string that says:

....
<% if (enrolment.courseClass.course.isVET == true) { %>
....

Replace it with:

....
<% if (enrolment.courseClass.course.modules.size() > 0) { %>
....

enabled that rely on tutors electronically marking the roll, we suggest
you enable this monitoring script also. `#26608`
* A new script has been added to onCourse called 'send payment plan
reminder'. When enabled, this script sends a reminder to the invoice

has had the second page Transcript report removed. Now, if the Statement
of Attainment contains more units than will fit on a single page, the
certificate will break into multiple pages, with the correct formatting
for each page. The certificate number will be appended with /1, /2 ect
as additional pages are created. If you use the default Certificate
template and print with a two page background, you should change the
background to a single page and re-test the print process. `#28313`

* Improvement to the 'send certificate vet created notification' script
to set the issued on date to the day the certificate was automatically
printed and distributed to the student. If you are using this script,
you should open the script record and click 'update to latest version'.
`#28724 and #28579`
* Improvement to the 'send weekly finance summary report' script with
the addition of a send monthly option. If you are using this script and
want to enable the monthly option, first open the script record and
click 'update to the latest version'. Then, comment out the weekly time
range, and uncomment the monthly time range `#27107`
* Additional CRON times have been added to a drop down list, so rather
than having to write a custom schedule for each script, you can select a

ensure the class list displays correctly in MS Outlook 2013. To apply
this change, you will need to get the latest copy of the template from
https://github.com/ari/oncourse-scripts/tree/master/email[GIT Hub] and
add in any customisations you may have made to this template `#27122`
* The Tax Invoice plain text and HTML templates have been updated to
