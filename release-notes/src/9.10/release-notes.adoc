= Release 9.10
11 Apr. 2019


== Major features

Some more big additions are coming with this release, the most exciting
of which is the all-new Dashboard. You may remember we flirted with a
new Dashboard some time ago; this one is now much improved, containing
some wonderful new features we think will help make accessing different
parts of onCourse easier than ever before, such as the ability to save a
selection of your most commonly used windows for quick access, and a new
'Find Anything' search where you can find almost any record by simply
typing something into the box.

As well as the Dashboard, the following list views and their entities
have been moved to the new UI design.

* Accounts
* Transactions
* Tutor pay

As always, holding down the "shift" key while opening a window will
still allow you to use the old UI. While you can also go back to the old
Dashboard from within the File > Preferences navigation menu.

A Dark Theme has been added to the application and can be accessed from
the top right of the new dashboard.
