= Release 9.11



== Major features

This release is an incremental step towards rolling out the new user
interface along with a number of bug fixes. Screens migrated to the new
UI in this release are:

* Banking
* Audit
* Funding upload
* Funding contracts configuration
* Corporate pass
* Script (this was partially done previously)

=== Funding uploads

If you are an RTO reporting AVETMISS data to your funding provider,
you'll be really excited by this new feature. Here you'll be able to see
every historic export and flag its upload status so that you can track
which outcomes have been reported and what status was reported each
time. This will make it much easier to track your funding entitlements
and see exactly when money is due to you.
