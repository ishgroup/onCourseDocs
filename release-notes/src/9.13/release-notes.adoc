= Release 9.13
18 Aug 2019


== Important changes

As of this release, users of onCourse are _required to have an email
address_ against their user record in the system. Users who do not will
no longer be able to login until they have a valid email address against
their user record.

We've also begun to remove some older portions of the application that
are no longer in use, beginning with the AVETMISS 7 export window and
the old Scripts window. We've also removed the feature that could allow
you to freeze documents to a specific version.

== Major features

=== Tag colours

We have implemented a colour picker that will allow you to assign a hex
colour to any tag, which will help with visual identification of records
in across certain parts of the application.

=== New font

A change of the font used throughout the user interface. The new Inter
font is more readable and has some nice stylistic options for numbers
which makes them clearer.

=== New user interface

The new user interface has now been rolled out to the following areas:

* Certificates
* Voucher products
* Memberships
* Products
* Sales (product items)
* Messages
* Student Feedback
* Applications
* Invoices
* Discounts
* Payments In

=== Use of credit notes in online checkout

Students can now use any credit saved on their student records for
online checkout. When they make a purchase from your website, provided
they use the same first name, last name and email address as the record
that has the credit saved, that credit will automatically be applied to
the final total at checkout. Any credit not used will remain available
on their account for future use.
