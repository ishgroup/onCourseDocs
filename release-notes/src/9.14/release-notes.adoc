= Release 9.14
10 Oct 2019


== Important changes

With export templates, integrations and scripts now moved to the new
Automation window and the new user interface, we've locked down all
built-in onCourse exports so they can't be modified. Instead, you can
duplicate and modify your own copy of those exports whenever you need
to. This means that the built-in exports will automatically update with
any new features or bug fixes in each release of onCourse.

We've reviewed all our customer systems and for any exports you have
modified, we've duplicated them for you already so that your changes are
not overwritten.

== Major features

=== Contact merge

The contact merging has been redesigned to be easier to use.

=== Simplify access to advanced search

Instead of having to switch between advanced and simple search, the
search field figures out what you are trying to do and displays the
records you are looking for.

=== Exports with variables and options

Exports can now be given variables to be entered at the time of the
export. For example, you might create an export for a date range and
prompt the user at the time of export for the date.
