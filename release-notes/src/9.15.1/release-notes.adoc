== Release 9.15

=== Important changes

Two financial issues were discovered recently and fixes for them are in
9.15. The issues manifested in two ways. Firstly, a small number of
invoices are missing their General Ledger transactions entirely for
records created roughly between March and July of this year. We are
seeing only a couple of dozen instances across all our customers.

Secondly, in December 2018 we introduced a feature to allow discounts to
link to a Cost of Sales account rather than reducing income. This worked
well, except when you cancelled that enrolment which linked to this new
type of discount and created a credit note. The transactions reversing
the COS and the associated debtor transactions were missing.

Note that these issues do not affect your invoices or payments. They
will not affect the amount of money you have in the bank or your
reconciliation. The only effect is to your trial balance or any
reporting to your accounting integrations. You might find that debtors
in the trial balance don't match the total invoices owing. The invoice
list is correct.

After you upgrade, onCourse will create all the missing transactions
automatically. Additional checks will run on every restart from now on.
Those missing transactions will be created with today's date, unless
they occurred in 2018 in which case they will be given a date of 31
December 2018. This should allow your accounting integrations to catch
up automatically without touching closed years.

=== Major features

This latest release focuses largely on bug fixes, including lots of
usability improvements to search functions, and some more progress on
our migration from the old style onCourse to the new user interface.
Reports have been removed from its own window and now lives in the
Automation section. You can now also set default PDF backgrounds within
the report record itself, as well as when you go to print. It contains a
new Preview window which will display a preview of your selected report,
provided it's been printed at least once. You can see an example of how
this looks below.

We've also removed the Debtors and Creditors Report from the system as
it had a number of issues in it, and replaced with a much better export
called the Historic Aged Debtors Export. You will be able to access this
export from the Invoices window.
