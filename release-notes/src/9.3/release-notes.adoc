= Release 9.3
30 Jun 2017


== Major features

=== Data collection rules

Since the beginning of onCourse you have been able to select which
fields are visible and which are mandatory for online enrolments. You
can also specify the rules for mailing lists and waiting lists.

Now Data Collection rules take this idea to the next level. You are able
to define rule sets for which fields are visible and mandatory, then
link those rule sets back to specific courses. So your VET courses might
have one set of data fields and your leisure courses a smaller set. Your
seminar programme might then collect data about meal choices and
streams.

The Data Collection rules can be very detailed. Each field can be
re-ordered, you can separate them with headings and text of your choice.
You can rename the labels and help text.

We think you'll love the flexibility that comes with Data Collection
rules and you'll be able to collection just the data you need without
overwhelming students with too many choices.

Data Collection chapter] of the user documentation.

=== Custom fields
