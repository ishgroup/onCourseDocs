= Release 9.4
14 Dec 2017

== Major features

=== Dashboard

onCourse now has a new dashboard which you can access from the File >
Preferences > New Dashboard. It is still in beta testing so we would
appreciate your feedback to let us know how it works for you. It
includes some new features:

* Smart search across many entities in one go e.g. searching 'cook' will
give you results of courses and class containing the name cook, and
contacts whose name contains cook.
* Ability to personally customise your list of frequently used elements
of onCourse using the favourites function
* An easier way to find the functions of onCourse you need to use via
search e.g. type discount in the search bar in press enter on your
keyboard to open the discount window

=== Website eCommerce engine

Significant updates to the online sales process have taken place in the
last release, to allow you to implement your data collection rules
(released in 9.3) into the checkout process, including the addition of
enrolment, application and waiting list custom fields.

This means you can now ask additional per enrolment / per application
specific questions of each student, replacing processes that may have
been asked post enrolment or via surveys.

* Add custom enrolment fields to the checkout `OD-11002`
* Display custom application fields in checkout `OD-11182`
* Implement Waiting list form for checkout app `OD-11188`
* Checkout: CorporatePass preference only enabled when active corporate

=== AVETMISS improvements with funding contracts

The AVETMISS export runner window has undergone some significant updates
to make it simpler to use and to provide you with more options when
exporting your data to various reporting agencies.

Most significantly, the export runner will pre-count the outcomes that
will be exported, advise you of any that need a final outcome status
because their end date is in the past, and allow you to set an override
end date option for export to push their end date into the future.

The new funding contact option will allow you to set classes and
enrolments belonging to specific state funding programs, which is a list
you can extend with as many program types as you wish.

A history of each export you run is stored in onCourse as a funding
upload, allowing you to track when you last reported and set if the
funding export from onCourse was accepted by the funding agency.
