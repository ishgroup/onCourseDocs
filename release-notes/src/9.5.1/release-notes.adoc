== Major features

=== Student feedback

Student feedback has gone from being a minor feature in the portal to a
first class part of onCourse.

onCourse now includes the ability to view, edit and approve for
publication student testimonials captured through the onCourse portal
student feedback process. These testimonials will then become part of
the marketing copy of your course pages.

More more information on this feature, please review the
https://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/latest/manual/feedback.html[Feedback
and Surveys] chapter in the user handbook.

=== New editor

Our new editor has now replaced the old CMS. It is more powerful and
much easier to use. Built on a modern React framework it allows us to
more quickly add new functionality to your site. You now have the
ability to roll back to previous site versions as well as suppress
certain pages from your sitemap, and you can now edit the 301 redirects
in WebDav.

To access the new editor, add #editor to the end of your website URL
e.g. www.mycollege.com#editor. You then can log in using the email
account associated with your onCourse user account, and password. You
must have 'can edit CMS' access rights in your onCourse user account to
access the #editor.

=== Editor API

The new editor https://www.ish.com.au/s/onCourse/doc/editor-api/v1/[now
also has an API]. This is a very important step forward in the refresh
of our technology stack. You can script actions to do anything that the
editor UI itself can do, right through to publishing your site.
