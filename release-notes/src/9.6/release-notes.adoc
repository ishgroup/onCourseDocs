= Release 9.6
28 Jul 2018


== Important changes

When you first run onCourse 9.6, it downloads all the new application
resources as usual. Note that this release has a very large set of new
resources totalling about 190Mb so this might take some time on slower
connections. It is not expected that every future release will be this
large since it incrementally just downloads changes resources.

== Major features

onCourse now supports Java 9 and 10. You can upgrade your local
installation of Java past version 8 now, although there is no need to do
so until Java 8 is discontinued in 2019. Java 11 drops the webstart
functionality which means you'll need to install a client onCourse
application manually after each upgrade. We'll have a solution for that
in 2019, in the meantime it will be easier if you remain on Java 10.
Also note that we needed to rebuild how the attendance view in the class
edit screen scrolls horizontally to work around some Java 9 issues. This
will only impact you if you have a large number of sessions in a class.

We have also completely rebuilt the user interface for general
preferences. There are only minor functional changes as this is our
prototype of the new UI which will be progressively rolled out across
the whole application. We welcome feedback on the usability of these
changes.

The third major change in this release is a complete rebuild of the way
the server application initialises itself. Although this isn't a user
visible change, it will help us to better fine tune server caching,
memory usage and performance.

print process fail when one or more survey responses has a blank
response. `OD-11771`

== Web features

* Changing the class hiding date will now change search results. That
is, if you set classes to disappear from the website 5 days before they
finish, that should change which courses are found in a search.
`OD-10279`

"/about-us"). `OD-11923`

== Web fixes

* Fixed an issue where "Near" courses searched sorts results
incorrectly. We were assigning sort weight by distance in the wrong
units which threw off some of the results. `OD-11920`
* Fixed an issue where searching for "after date before today" by URL
query threw an error. You can use a URL like /courses?after=20180820 but
previously that would only work if the date was in the future.
