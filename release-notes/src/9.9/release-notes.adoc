= Release 9.9
12 Feb 2019


== Major features

This is one of our most feature packed releases in the history of
onCourse. The new user interface rollout is gaining momentum as we solve
UX problems. Although 'sites and rooms' are not something you use often,
the technology we built here will quickly appear across all of onCourse.
For this reason it is really important you give us your feedback as soon
as possible. What do you find easy to use and what changes confuse you?
Now is the time to talk to us.

=== Sites and rooms

In 9.8 we rolled out the new user interface to Modules and
Qualifications. Those were fairly simple, but now sites and rooms are
done and we've implemented the following key features:

* exporting
* printing
* tags (adding, searching)
* custom filters
* new search syntax for #tags and @customFilters
* three column list view (editing records without leaving the list)
* displaying, adding and editing notes
* displaying, adding and editing documents

=== Query language

The new sites and rooms screens implement the onCourse query language,
including support for searching on tags and custom filters. A whole new
section of the manual details how to use this feature. It is important
that you understand how this works because the new functionality will be
rolled out across the entire onCourse. It is extremely powerful and much
faster to use than the old advanced search.

=== Custom modules and units

You can now add your own VET component data to onCourse which isn't
sourced from TGA. This is useful for state based Modules which aren't on
TGA, skill sets and for non-VET CSO delivery. No longer do you need us
to update the data for you, but you can add components whenever you
want.
