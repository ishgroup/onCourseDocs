== onCourse CMS - Editor

[[editorIntroduction]]
=== Introduction

The onCourse Editor is your platform to create, manage and distribute information to your website. Editor is a Content Management System (CMS) that provides simple but powerful tools to manage the structure and content of your website in a collaborative environment.

[[editorAccess]]
==== Access to the Editor

Before you start editing content within the Editor you need to set up a user name and password in onCourse to log in.

onCourse enables any user to also have the ability to log into and edit content within the Editor using the same log in credentials that you use to access onCourse . To do this go to the Security window in onCourse, click on the user in the left-hand column, then ensure they have 'Can access #editor' switched on in their user record.

[[editorLoggingIn]]
==== Logging In

Access the editor by visiting your website and adding `#editor` at the end of the url. For example, if your website url is
`http://www.acme.com.au` the editor can be accessed at `http://www.acme.com.au#editor`.

Log in using your email address.

[[editorView]]
==== The Editor View

Once logged in, a toolbar is visible to the left-hand side of the window. You can continue to browse through your site as normal while logged into the Editor.

On the toolbar, you can see icons that allows you to quickly access the primary areas of the Editor. At the bottom of the toolbar, there is an option to publish any changes you've made. This will push all your changes to the production servers, so they are visible to everyone.

While you are logged into the editor you are looking at a draft version of the site which cannot be seen by anyone not also logged into the editor. Changes you make with webDAV (static files, images, javascript, css, etc) are also only visible while logged in to the editor, until you publish the site.

[[editorContent]]
=== Editing Content

Click the Content icon to see the editor for Blocks, Pages and Themes. These three components make up the structure of the website.

image::images/editor_content.png[]

You can add content to Blocks and Pages using one of three different markup styles that you can set per block/page; Rich (markdown), html or 'legacy', which is our older-style of textile markup. We recommend using the Rich mode for ease of use, and for the fact that it alows the use of markdown and most html. With a suitably skilled web designer you could take your website a long way.

[[editorBlocks]]
==== Blocks

Blocks are re-usable snippets of text, pictures, markup, etc. If you wanted to add a banner on every page of your website, or an area on different pages dedicated to a contact form, blocks are ideal. Even if you only use them once, they are a convenient way to break apart complicated pages into easy to edit pieces.

image::images/editor_blocks.png[title='The Blocks page allows you to easily add,search and edit blocks.']

===== Editing a block

Selecting a block takes you to the Editor page for that specific block. Here, you can change the name of the block and edit the contents. On the right-hand side of the screen you see a preview of what the block will look like on your website.

Click on the block contents to open the block in a text editor view. Here you can set the style of markup to use using the drop-down box in the top right. Enter your markup and content to be added to the block and click save. This closes the text editor and renders your changes for you to review.

image::images/editor_BlocksHTML.png[]

You can navigate back to the Blocks page by clicking the burger menu icon in the top-left corner of the window, and by clicking Blocks again. You can also navigate directly to a block by hovering your mouse over the Blocks sectiona nd selecting a bock from the list that appears.

image::images/editorBlocksBack.png[]

===== Creating a new block

You can create a new Block from the Block view by clicking on 'ADD NEW'. You will have to give your new block a name in the 'Title' field, as well as some content/markup. Remember that if you're editing an existing block, renaming it might break it in places you have embedded that block elsewhere.

Once you are happy with your new block, save it by hitting the blue 'SAVE' button. If you wish to discard the new block, hit the red 'REMOVE' button.

image::images/editorNewBlock.png[]

[[editorPages]]
==== Pages

Many pages on your website are automatically generated from onCourse. These pages include:

* /courses
* /courses/arts/photography
* /course/ABC
* /sites
* /tutor/123
* /site/234
* /checkout

Pages not automatically generated from onCourse can be created in the Editor.
The Pages view shows a list of all the static pages in your website and gives you quick access to search for, edit and delete pages.
Similar to the Block view, clicking on a Page will open text editor.

===== Editing existing pages

From the Content menu, select Pages to get a list of all static pages on your site.

image::images/editor_pages.png[]

When a specific page is selected the editor allows you to change the theme that is applied to this page, the page name, as well as editing the content. You can also select whether any given page is 'visible'. The page title will be visible in the window title of the user's browser. Every page will be given an automatic URL like /page/5 however you may wish to give it an easier to use URLs like /terms or /about/contact-us. You can even give a page multiple URLs which will all work to display the same page to the user. Only one of the pages will be 'canonical', and the others will redirect to it.

You can also select to have a page omitted from the site map. Hiding a page from the sitemap will make it invisible to web crawlers and search engines.

image::images/editor_pagesEdit.png[]

The text fields are versatile in that they will let you select one of three markup varieties to work with; rich text (based on Markdown), legacy (textile-based rich text markup used by onCourse in the past) and advanced (html), for when you just want onCourse to get out of your way and let you type things out in HTML.

The Rich Text mode has a built-in visual editor that makes it very easy for all users to enter content. You can use the Write view to enter pure markup, or use Preview to see the correct formatting while you type.

You can learn more about the different types of markup modes, particularly rich text and legacy modes, in our <<richText, Markup>> chapter.

===== Create new pages

Click the 'ADD NEW' button to create a new blank page. Here you can edit the pages Title, the pages URL as well as the theme that is applied to this page. You can also toggle if the new page is visible.

Clicking the 'Sample content' will open the page in the text editor to be edited. You can select the markup style to be used on the page in the drop-down box in te top-right.

Once you have finished creating your new page, you will have to save it by hitting the blue 'SAVE' button or discard your changes by the red 'REMOVE' button.

image::images/editor_newPage.png[]

[[editorMenus]]
==== Menus

From the Content view, the primary header navigation can be edited from 'Menus'.

Most websites have a primary navigation menu which users will use to find their way around. In Menu's you can add new menu items, and link them to particular pages or external URLs.

===== Edit an existing menu item

Click on a menu name to edit it. The menu name is as shown on your website.

Click, hold and drag the menu items into a different order or nest them within other menu items.

Click to edit the URL, that is, the page to which the menu links. Ensure this matches the page name exactly. If it doens't, it won't work as you expect.

Menus exist in a hierarchy. Clicking, holding and drag a menu item to reorder the menu. Clicking and dragging a menu item on top of, and to the right of another will nest the menu item and make it a submenu item.

image::images/editor_menus.png[]

===== Add a new menu item

Clicking 'ADD NEW ITEM' will create a new menu item with no URL. This menu item will appear as the top menu level and will not link to any page.

A menu item can be deleted by clicking the red 'REMOVE' button to the right of each menu item.

Once you are happy with your changes, you can save them by clicking the blue 'SAVE' button.

[[editorSettings]]
=== Settings

The editor allows you to manage a number of different aspects of how the website and portal display information. This includes determining what information can be viewed through the SkillsonCourse portal, general website settings, any checkout settings or preferences and the site's 301 redirects.

image::images/editor_settings.png[]

[[editorSkillsOnCourse]]
==== SkillsOnCourse

The SkillsonCourse Settings page allows you to manage the amount of information that is able to Tutors in the SkillsonCourse portal.

image::images/editor_settingsSkillsOnCourse.png[]

*Hide student contact details from tutor*: When a tutor is viewing the class roll via the SkillsonCourse, you can determine whether you want them to be able to view the email address, phone numbers of each student listed on the class roll. Please note that it is not possible to not display the contact details for one class, but display it for another, as this setting is universally applied.

The below SkillsonCourse portal view shows the student contact details displayed within the class roll. By specifying that you do not want the contact details to be displayed, this class list would simply show as a list of student names.

image::images/cms_set_portal_info_display.png[]

[[editorWebsite]]
==== Website Settings

The website settings page gives a few different options on how things are displayed on the website.

image::images/editor_settingsWebsite.png[]

*Add This* is a powerful social media linking tool that enables you to insert social media links into your web pages, as well as giving you access to analytical tools to gain insight into your audience.

Add This accounts are free and the first step is to create a new account. Do this by clicking the 'Click here' link. Set up your account including specifying which social media links you wish to display on your website, the size and format of those links, as well as the free analytics tools that are part of your account set up.

Once complete, insert the Add This id into the field provided. You can choose what pages the Add This! buttons appear on by ticking the 'Course' or 'Web Page' boxes below the Add This! field.

Add This also gives you a snippet of HTML to put into your site. You can put this HTML snippet into a page or block manually.

[source,html]

<!-- AddThis Button BEGIN -->
<div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style ">
    <a class="addthis_button_preferred_1"></a>
    <a class="addthis_button_preferred_2"></a>
    <a class="addthis_button_preferred_3"></a>
    <a class="addthis_button_preferred_4"></a>
    <a class="addthis_button_compact"></a>
    <a class="addthis_counter addthis_bubble_style"></a>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-4f0fc25723d304e0"></script><
!-- AddThis Button END-->

If you insert the social media links to your course information, it displays as follows.

image::images/adding_social_media_links.png[title='Example of how you can add social media links to any courses on your website']

*Hide Classes on Website/Stop web enrolments* Here you can set classes to hide or stop taking enrolments automatically after some threshold is passed. For examples, after a class starts, before a class starts after a class ends or beforea class ends.

*Show Suburbs from* The 'Show suburbs from' dropdown allows you to filter out suburbs being returned in the site search. For example, when entering the search query 'Newtown', with 'Show suburbs from' set to 'All states' the advanced search will return classes from:

* NEWTOWN, 2042
* NEWTOWN, 3220
* NEWTOWN, 3351
* NEWTOWN, 4305
* NEWTOWN, 4350

Setting 'Show suburbs from' to NSW will just return:

* NEWTOWN, 2042

Once you have finished changing your website settings, hit 'SAVE' to apply them.

[[editorCheckout]]

The checkout page gives you some simple options to set around when users access the /checkout part of your website.

*Allow create new student* - allows new student records to be created by users on the website. Disable this if you only want to allow students you or your staff have added to onCourse manually to use the checkout.

*Collect parent or guardian details for students under <x>* - turn on if you wish to collect parent/guardian details for students under the set age\

*Terms and conditions checkbox label* - The text that displays alongside your terms and conditions checkbox in the website checkout. The default text is 'I understand the enrolment, sale and refund policy.'

*Terms and conditions url* - The relative path of the terms and conditions page. Should always start with a /. Default is /terms.

[[editorRedirect]]
==== Redirect

The redirect settings allow you to create 301 redirects to your website by entering the path in the field on the left (starting with '/') and the destination in the field on the right (either starting with '/' for another local page or starting with http/https for redirecting to another website)

image::images/editor_settingsRedirect.png[]

==== Editing an existing redirect

You can edit an existing redirect by changing the *From* and *To* parameters.

==== Adding a new redirect

Clicking 'ADD NEW' creates a new redirect at the bottom of the redirects, with blank *From* and *To* parameters.

Once you have finished editing the list of redirects, click 'SAVE' to add the redirects to your site.

[[editorDesign]]
=== Design

The Design menu lets you edit the Themes applied to your onCourse website.

image::images/editor_design.png[]

[[Theme]]
==== Themes

Themes are a way to describe a page structure made up by a number of blocks and is a design layout created for you by your designer. There will always be a layout called "default". If you want different parts of your site to have very different looks, ask your designer to create alternative layouts for you to use.

Themes are applied by URL path. This will allow you to set up cetain themes for different sections of your site based on the URL e.g. if you have a tag URL for all your business courses that uses the /course/business URL path on your website, you can have a special theme for all pages that appear under this path.

To apply the theme to a URL path, just add the URL path to the 'New Page URL' field and click the green + button to confirm. After confirming, a drop-down box appears where you set whether this will apply to all pages starting with this URL, or only pages with this exact URL. Be sure to Save after setting your changes and publishing.

You can apply the same theme to multiple paths by simply adding the additional paths using the same process as above.

Each theme can have a number of blocks arranged in any way you choose. There are five regions available:

* header
* left
* content
* right
* footer

Each region can contain one or more blocks which you click and drag from the right-hand side 'Blocks' area. To remove a block, click and drag it back into the list of unused blocks on the right. Order the blocks on the page by clicking and dragging them into position.

image::images/editor_designEditThemes.png[]

[NOTE]
====
When editing or creating themes for pages, make sure you don't overwrite any default theme. You must always ensure there is a default theme set up for standard pages. This must always be set with the URL as "/" with a type of 'Starts with'.

image::images/editor_revertHistory.png[]

[[editorPublish]]
=== Publishing your changes
