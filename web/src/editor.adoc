[[editorIntroduction]]
=== Introduction

The onCourse Editor is your platform to create, manage and distribute information to your website.
Editor is a Content Management System (CMS) that provides simple but powerful tools to manage the structure and content of your website in a collaborative environment.

[[editorAccess]]
==== Access to the Editor

Before you start editing content within the Editor you need to set up a user name and password to log in.

onCourse enables any user to also have the ability to log into and edit content within the Editor using the same log in credentials that you use to access onCourse . To do this go to the Security window in onCourse, click on the user in the left-hand column, then ensure they have 'Can access #editor' switched on in their user record.

[[editorView]]
==== The Editor View

Once logged in, a toolbar is visible to the left hand side of the window.
You can continue to browse through your site as normal while logged into the Editor.

On the toolbar, you can see icons that allows you to quickly access the primary areas of the Editor.
At the bottom of the toolbar, there is an option to publish any changes you've made.
This will push all your changes to the production servers, so they are visible to everyone.

While you are logged into the editor you are looking at a draft version of the site which cannot be seen by anyone not also logged into the editor.
Changes you make with webDAV (static files, images, javascript, css, etc) are also only visible while logged in to the editor, until you publish the site.

These three components make up the structure of the website.

[[editorBlocks]]
==== Blocks

Blocks are re-usable snippets of text, pictures, rich text markup, etc.
If you wanted to add a banner on every page of your website, or an area on different pages dedicated to a contact form, blocks are ideal.
Even if you only use them once, they are a convenient way to break apart complicated pages into easy to edit pieces.

image::images/editor_blocks.png[title='The Blocks page allows you to easily add,search and edit blocks.']

===== Editing a block

Selecting a block takes you to the Editor page for that specific block.
Here, you can change the name of the block and edit the contents.
On the right hand side of the screen you see a preview of what the block will look like on your website.

Click on the block contents to open the block in a text editor view.
Enter your rich text or html to be added to the block and click save.
This closes the text editor and renders your changes for you to review.

You can navigate back to the Blocks page by clicking the title of the block in the top right hand corner.

===== Creating a new block

You can create a new Block from the Block view by clicking on 'ADD NEW'.
You will have to give your new block a name in the 'Title' field, as well as some rich text or HTML in the content field do the right.

These pages include:

* /courses
* /courses/arts/photography
* /course/ABC
* /sites
* /tutor/123
* /site/234
* /checkout

Pages not automatically generated from onCourse can be created in the Editor.
The Pages view shows a list of all the static pages in your website and gives you quick access to search for, edit and delete pages.
Similar to the Block view, clicking on a Page will open text editor.

===== Editing existing pages

When a specific page is selected the editor allows you to change the theme that is applied to this page, the page name, as well as editing the content.
You can also select whether any given page is 'visible'.
The page title will be visible in the window title of the user's browser.
Every page will be given an automatic URL like /page/5 however you may wish to give it an easier to use URLs like /terms or /about/contact-us.
You can even give a page multiple URLs which will all work to display the same page to the user.
Only one of the pages will be 'canonical', and the others will redirect to it.

Hiding a page from the sitemap will make it invisible to web crawlers and search engines.
