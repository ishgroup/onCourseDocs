== SkillsOnCourse Portal

=== Introduction

skillsOnCourse is a website for tutors and students which allows them to interact with your college and their classes.

It's a place where students can receive class documents, give class feedback, make payments or update their student details.

Tutors can mark class rolls, upload documents for a class, leave notes on classes for onCourse admins and more.

Company logins can review progress of related employee contacts, pay invoices and review provided company information.

skillsOnCourse provides a way to give 24-hour assistance to help students and tutors get the answers they need.

=== Portal Set up

Your SkillsOnCourse portal URL will match the onCourse system key your college uses for its onCourse instance. For example, if you logged in to onCourse at testcollege.oncourse.cloud.cc then your college's default portal URL will be https://testcollege.skillsoncourse.com.au

=== Creating accounts and setting passwords

From the moment they are created in onCourse, students will automatically have a skillsOnCourse account created. They just need to set a password in order to log in.

They can do this by going to the login page for your portal, entering their first and last name and email address, then clicking 'forgot password'. They will be sent an email prompting them to click a link which will lead them to the password set window.

Passwords must have a minimum of 12 characters, with at least one uppercase and one lowercase character each, at least one special character, and at least one number. The password reset page has indicators to help tell you whether the password you're trying to use is secure enough or not.

The system will not let people set an unsecure or simple password, so we encourage the use of a password generator.

=== Logging in

The skillsOnCourse login screen will prompt the student or tutor to enter their details.

Just like the onCourse enrolment process, a student is identified their first and last name and an email address to avoid forcing students and tutors to remember another user id.

image::images/Tutor Portal Log In Screen.png[title='skillsOnCourse web login page']

It's also possible to log into skillsOnCourse as a Company rather than an individual.

To do so, click the 'As A Person' switch over to 'As A Company', then enter the name, email address and password for your company log in.

==== Recovering and Resetting Passwords

The main login screen for the skillsOnCourse portal includes a 'forgot password' link.

The student or tutor will need to provide a first name, last name and valid email address in order to initiate the process. Companies will need their company name and associated email address. If the contact doesn't have an email address in onCourse then they must get in touch with the college so that you can manually update their record.

Students must have a valid email address for this process to work. Passwords cannot be updated within onCourse itself. Only the SkillsOnCourse password reset emails can be used to set passwords.

If the user clicks on the forgot password link and enters the other details, an email will be sent to them with a link to enable them create a new password.

This link will be valid for 24 hours only, after that time the link within the email will not work. Once the student has reset their password, they can continue using skillsOnCourse.

....
Dear {name},

To reset your SkillsOnCourse password, simply click the link below. That will take you to a web page where you can create a new password. Please note that the link will expire 24 hours after this email was sent.

  {recoveryLink}

If you weren't trying to reset your password, don't worry - your account is still secure and no one has been given access to it. Most likely, someone just mistyped their email address while trying to reset their own password.
....

== Student Portal

Once a student has logged into their skillsonCourse portal they will see their dashboard.

The display of resources in the portal is based on the permissions set for the document inside the onCourse application. Documents with the permission 'Student and tutor' show in the portal for both students and tutors. Documents with the permission 'Tutor only' show only to tutors, and are a suitable permission for resources like assessment marking guides.

The skillsOnCourse dashboard also contains links to the newest resources added to the portal for the student or tutor.

A student has the ability to make credit card payments in the skillsOnCourse portal, so debtors are allowed to make payments against their outstanding invoices or payment plans.

A student has an option to reduce the amount they want to pay if they can't afford to pay the full amount at the present time, with a minimum limit of $20 unless the total overdue amount is less than this.
Once the user has defined the amount they want to pay the student just needs to enter the credit card details of person making the payment.
The user will then get a message notifying them if the payment was successful or if it failed.
If the payment fails, then a few seconds after getting a notification of this they will get directed back to the payment page allowing them to try again.
