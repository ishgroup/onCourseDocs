== General

=== Introduction

skillsOnCourse is a website for tutors and students which allows them to interact with your college and with each other.

Every student and tutor is automatically given a login when their record is created in onCourse or when they enrol online.

skillsOnCourse gives tutors the information they need without having to contact you regularly.
"Is my class full?", "Will my class go ahead?", "Can I get a class roll".

These are all things that your teaching staff will ask you every day; now you have a 24-hour assistance to help tutors get the answers they need.

Students can quickly and easily get the information they need about their classes and timetable.

=== Creating accounts and logging in

All students when they are created in onCourse, will automatically have a skillsOnCourse account set up for them. The first time a student enrols in your college, they will be sent an email which allows them to log into skillsOnCourse and set their password. Tutors are also given an account when their record is created in onCourse.

The skillsOnCourse login screen will prompt the student or tutor to enter their details.
Like the onCourse enrolment process, a student is identified by name and email address to avoid forcing students and tutors to remember another user id.

image::images/Tutor Portal Log In Screen.png[title='skillsOnCourse web login page']

It is also possible to log into skills onCourse as a Company rather than an individual.
To do so simply click the 'as person' switch and it will change to 'as company', then enter the email address and password for your company.

==== Auto-detect first time users

skillsOnCourse has the ability to auto detect first time visitors to the site, when following a login link from onCourse.
The direct link that they would visit is
https://www.skillsoncourse.com.au/portal/login?e=email@gmail.com
replacing 'email@gmail.com' with the email address of the user.
The system will auto populate their name and email address and prompt them to create an account on their first visit as shown below.

image::images/First time users login screen.png[title='Auto-detect first time users login screen']

Once you click on 'CREATE ACCOUNT' button you will be taken to page, as shown below, notifying you that a link has been sent to your email address where you can create a password.

image::images/reset password message.png[title='Create new password message']

==== Recovering and Resetting Passwords

The main login screen for the skillsOnCourse portal includes a 'forgot password' link.
The user will need to provide a name and valid email address in order to initiate the process.
If the student or tutor does not have an email address in onCourse then they must contact the college so that you can manually update their record.
It is important that you implement an appropriate set of policies around how to authenticate users over the phone when they request that their email address be changed or added, since that email address will give them access to the full profile and history of the user.

If the user clicks on the forgot password link and enters the other details, an email will be sent to them with a link to enable them create a new password.
This link will be valid for 24 hours only, after that time the link within the email will not work.
Once the student has reset their password, they can continue using skillsOnCourse.

....
Dear {name},

To reset your SkillsOnCourse password, simply click the link below. That will take you to a web page
where you can create a new password. Please note that the link will expire 24 hours after
this email was sent.

  {recoveryLink}

If you weren't trying to reset your password, don't worry - your account is still secure and no
one has been given access to it. Most likely, someone just mistyped their email address
while trying to reset their own password.
....

==== Dashboard

Once a user has logged into their skillsonCourse portal they will see a number of blocks that will allow the user to see areas that can be reviewed or need actioned.

[[tutor]]
== Tutor Specific Features

=== Tutor Specific Features

Some features are only visible to tutors, including real time marking of the attendance roll for their classes.

==== Viewing and Marking a Class Roll

Tutors can access the attendance roll for the class they are teaching and mark the attendance records in real time, back to your onCourse database.
Only class rolls for sessions in progress, or in the past, can be marked.
Attendance can not be marked before the session has commenced.

If you have uploaded student profile images in onCourse, their image will appear along side their name assisting the tutors in verifying their identify. onCourse is also integrated with Gravatar, so if students have a loaded a profile image against a Gravatar profile using the same email address as they use in onCourse, this image will be used.

If a student is under 18, their age will show in brackets next to their name.

Students can be marked as attended, partially attended, absent or absent with reason.
For both partially attended and absent with a reason a note can be recorded against the attendance record to provide more information.

Marked attendance data is then used to calculate the student's attendance percentage.
This percentage may be important for reasons like CRICOS student visa compliance, or the college's own minimum attendance requirements in order to be eligible for a certificate of attendance.

The attendance roll can also list contact details such as mobile and email addresses for students, allowing the tutor to easily contact students as needed.
If this is enabled for students who are under 18, it will display the name of their Parent/Guardian and their contact details.

image::images/Tutor Portal Classes Menu Marking Roll.png[title='Live attendance tracking via the skillsonCourse portal']

image::images/marked_roll_mobile_portal.png[title='Marking the class roll on a mobile device']

image::images/child_roll.png[title='How an under-18 student's contact details display']

[TIP]
====
A College can set whether or they wish the Tutor to see the contact details of the students via the Website CMS under the Site Settings menu.
Whether you want this information displayed is dependent upon the policies of your business and the management of student records.
This setting is for all tutors of the college.
====

==== Approving Class Information

Tutors can confirm their availability for a given Class using the Portal.

To access any classes that a Tutor has not yet confirmed their availability for, simply click on the To Confirm menu within the Portal.

There is also a dialog box available to the tutor so they can send in comments and or suggested amendments to the course copy. If a tutor sends in comments these are emailed to the system admin email set in Preferences.

College staff then approve and update the changes via onCourse.

Tutors cannot edit the course schedule or description themselves, since it needs to be properly approved by College administrative staff.

The date of approval is shown as a date of confirmation in the Tutor section of the class.

image::images/Skills_onCourse_Tutor_Class_Approval.png[title='Tutors can confirm availability for a given Class via the Portal']

==== Viewing Student Results

Tutors have the ability to view a list of results for each unit of competency for their students.
They will be marked either 'Pass', 'Not Yet Competent' or 'No Result'.
The AVETMISS specific value of the outcome is displayed below this summary label

image::images/Tutor Portal Classes Menu Results Tab.png[title='Student Assessment Sorted by Unit of Competency']

==== Marking in the tutor portal

You can give your tutors access to mark their student's outcomes in the tutor portal.
This will save time for the tutor and the college, and will give you fast, accurate results in your onCourse database.
The system is simple and easy to use for tutors, and has the advantage of updating the onCourse database automatically, so no further staff time is needed to have up to date results for AVETMISS reporting or certificate issuing purposes.

If your existing assessment strategy is for tutors to determine competency and notify the college, this system will be easy for you to enable, as it simply moves the notification to an online, integrated platform.

Tutors will be able to mark the students competent, not yet competent, no result and withdrawn in the portal. onCourse will automatically assign the correct reporting codes based on the student's enrolment.
The tutor is also be able select the date the outcome is marked as the end date of the outcome.
This will override the existing outcome end date (or planned outcome end date) in the database.

All other VET Outcomes, such as 51- Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and 60- Credit transfer (CT) are only available to college staff.
This is to ensure the internal processes are meet before they are entered into your database.

We recommend you have a policy for the tutors that outlines what settings you expect tutors to use.
Please feel free to send them <<tutor_outcome_marking>> or edit them to include your own process with the specific steps and setting for your college.

.Outcome Values in the portal and their values in onCourse
[width="100%",cols="20%,34%,46%",options="header",]
|===
|Portal |VET outcomes |non-VET outcomes
|Competent |20 - Competent |81 -Non-assessed enrolment - Satisfactorily

|Not Yet Competent |30 - Competency not yet achieved / failed (NYC) |82
- Non-assessed enrolment - Withdrawn or not satisfactorily completed

|Withdrawn |40 - Withdrawn |82 - Non-assessed enrolment - Withdrawn or

|No Result |Not set |Not Set
|===

This feature is best for colleges that have a periodic, sample based assessment validation and moderation processes.
If your college does ongoing moderation and validation on each assessment, it may be worthwhile considering a shift to a periodic system.
Ongoing moderation and validation is a time intensive process that limits access to solutions that improve your overall efficiency and effectiveness.

Attendance and outcome marking in the portal enables your college to collect the most update to date and accurate training information from your tutors, and allows for you to access further benefits when combined with default scripts.

===== Enabling outcome marking via the tutor portal

You can enable marking in your CMS Site settings.
